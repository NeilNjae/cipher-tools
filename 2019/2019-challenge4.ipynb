NASA ENGINEERS ARE WORKING FAST TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM FOR APOLLO XIII AND THEY HAVE MITIGATIONS IN PLACE FOR XII'S RE-ENTRY, BUT THE VIEW OF THE EXPERTS IS THAT THEY DODGED A BULLET WITH THIS. THE FLIGHT OFFICER WHO REPORTED IT TO ME POINTED OUT THAT IF THE SOVIETS WANTED TO SABOTAGE THE MISSION THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GOOD BET: IT WAS A NASTY ACCIDENT THAT WAS HARD TO FORESEE, AND IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO SHOW THAT SOMEONE DELIBERATELY MISCALCULATED THE BURN TIMES SINCE IT WAS THE INTERACTION OF THE THRUSTERS AND STABILISERS THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. I THINK HE IS ONE OF A GROWING NUMBER OF NASA EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEGUN TO BELIEVE THAT THE USSR HAS DEEP COVER AGENTS WORKING TO DESTABILISE THE PROGRAMME. MY WORRY IS THAT EVEN IF HE IS WRONG, THE LACK OF TRUST THAT IS GROWING WITHIN THE ORGANISATION WILL DESTABILISE IT ON ITS OWN. I AM REALLY HOPING HE IS MISTAKEN. THE SUCCESS OF APOLLO XI SEEMS TO HAVE BOUGHT A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL GOODWILL AND I THINK IT COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE.
