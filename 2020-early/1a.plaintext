HARRY,
I AM REALLY SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BUT SOMETHING HAS COME UP AND THE SIS ARE TOO BUSY TO HELP. I AM HOPING YOU CAN.
FOLLOWING THE INVASION OF POLAND, WE ARE ALL ON DOUBLE DUTY, TRAWLING THROUGH OLD FILES FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO OUR FRIENDS IN EUROPE. MY TEAM HAS BEEN ASKED TO LOOK AT INTELLIGENCE FILES CONNECTED WITH AIR TRANSPORT AND I WAS GIVEN THE HINDENBURG DISASTER TO CHECK OUT.
THERE ISN'T MUCH TO GO ON AS MOST OF THE PAPERS RECOVERED FROM THE WRECKAGE WERE BADLY DAMAGED. WE DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS OF TRAVEL DOCUMENTS WHICH I HAVE SENT TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR ID CHECKS, BUT THAT WILL TAKE A WHILE, AND IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE BEEN EXAMINING SOME OF THE MORE UNUSUAL ITEMS.
THE MOST INTERESTING ONE IS A CHARRED ENVELOPE CARRYING A SWASTIKA AND MARKED DIE ALCHEMISTEN. I THINK THAT MIGHT BE WORTH INVESTIGATING.
THE CONTENTS WERE MISSING, BUT IN THE SAME EVIDENCE BAG I FOUND A FRAGMENT OF TORN BLUE PAPER WITH A NUMBER IN THE BOTTOM CORNER. THERE IS NO DESCRIPTION WITH IT, BUT I AM GUESSING THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN FOUND TOGETHER. WATER HAS DISSOLVED AND OBSCURED THE NUMBER SO I CAN'T READ IT AND I DON'T RECOGNISE THE FORMAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE WATER MUST HAVE PROTECTED IT FROM THE HEAT OF THE FLAMES AS THERE ARE NO BURN MARKS AND I WONDERED IF YOUR X-RAY TEAM MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSIST.
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE, OR HAVE YOU HEARD OF DIE ALCHEMISTEN? ANYTHING YOU HAVE WOULD BE GREAT. THANKS
PHIL
