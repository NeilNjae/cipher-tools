PHIL, IT IS GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU. THINGS ARE HECTIC HERE TOO, BUT IT IS MAINLY BUREAUCRACY AS WE TRY TO MAKE SURE ALL THE BOSS FIELD AGENTS HAVE SECURE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION AND ROUTES OUT OF TROUBLE IF THEY NEED THEM. IT IS ESSENTIAL WORK, BUT I HAVE BEEN ITCHING TO GET OUT THERE WITH THEM AND YOUR LETTER CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF DIE ALCHEMISTEN BEFORE, BUT IT DOES REMIND ME OF SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T QUITE PLACE. I WILL GET BACK TO YOU IF I REMEMBER. THE NUMBER IS SLIGHTLY EASIER. THIS LOOKS LIKE THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF A BLUEPRINT AND I ASSUME THE NUMBER IS RELATED TO THE DESIGN. THE X-RAY TEAM TOOK A SNAP WHICH INCREASED THE CONTRAST AND I THINK I CAN MAKE OUT THE LETTERS GB AT THE START, WHICH IS SUGGESTIVE. THE NEXT TWO DIGITS ARE NOT CLEAR, BUT THEY COULD BE EIGHT-THREE OR EIGHT-FIVE. I HAVE SENT A REQUEST TO THE UK MILITARY ATTACHE TO SEE IF HE RECOGNISES THE FORMAT.
I WILL BE IN TOUCH IN SEVEN DAYS.
HARRY
