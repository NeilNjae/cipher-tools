SIR CHARLES,

IT IS WITH REGRET THAT I FIND MYSELF IN DISAGREEMENT WITH YOU JUDGEMENT. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU ARE RIGHT IN ONE REGARD, IT IS TIME TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE OF SECRET SECRETARY, AND TO TAKE THE SECRET WAR TO OUR ENEMIES. ON ONE SIGNIFICANT POINT HOWEVER, I DO NOT AGREE. THIS ROLE IS NOT SUITED TO GOOD MEN WITH A REPUTATION FOR HONOUR. YOUR SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE CAPITAL IF I WERE LOOKING TO APPOINT A CHIEF OF STAFF OR A NEW FOREIGN SECRETARY, HOWEVER THE TASKS THAT WE BOTH KNOW ARE NECESSARY IF WE ARE TO PROTECT AND EXPAND THE EMPIRE WILL REQUIRE A MAN OF ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT CHARACTER. A RED BLOODED MAN WITH A BLACK HEART.

THERE IS ONE MAN WE BOTH KNOW WHO IS ENTIRELY SUITED TO THE LESS CONGENIAL ASPECTS OF MODERN STATECRAFT, AND I AM SURPRISED THAT YOU DID NOT ADD HIS NAME TO THE LIST - YOU AMERICAN COUSIN DOUGLAS BLACK. BLACK IS A MAN OF SINGULAR TALENTS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ACT WITH UTMOST SPEED TO BRING HIM TO LONDON. I BELIEVE THAT HE IS CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH AS YOU, AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE UP THE POST OF SECRET SECRETARY. I AM RATHER LOOKING FORWARD TO MY FIRST MEETING WITH MR. BLACK AND I TRUST YOU WILL NOT DISAPPOINT ME IN THIS, BUT IF YOU FIND THAT HE IS NOT AMENABLE TO REASON THEN I WILL FIND ANOTHER WAY TO PERSUADE HIM. A MAN LIKE BLACK ALWAYS HAS A SKELETON OR TWO IN HIS CLOSET!
