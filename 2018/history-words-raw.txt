[[File:Zakupy1853.jpg|thumb|right|Schloß Reichstadt, Lithograph 1853]]
'''The [[Zákupy|Reichstadt]] agreement''' was an agreement made between [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Russia]] in July 1876, who were at that time in an alliance with each other and [[German Empire|Germany]] in the [[League of the Three Emperors]], or ''Dreikaiserbund''. Present were the Russian and Austro-Hungarian emperors together with their foreign ministers, [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] of Russia and [[Count Andrassy]] of Austria-Hungary. The closed meeting took place on July 8 in the Bohemian city of Reichstadt (now [[Zákupy]]). They agreed on a common approach to the solution of the [[Eastern question]], due to the unrest in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the interests of the two major powers in the Balkans. They discussed the likely [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–1878, its possible outcomes and what should happen under each scenario.

The later [[Budapest Convention 1877|Budapest Convention]] of 1877 confirmed the main points, but when the war concluded with the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] in 1878, the terms of the treaty were quite different leading to Austrian insistence on convening a revision at the [[Congress of Berlin]] later that year. These events laid the background for the subsequent [[Bulgarian Crisis (1885–1888)|Bulgarian Crisis]] of 1885-1888, and ultimately [[World War I]].<ref name=ragsdale>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwvllKkPQtYC |editor-first=Hugh |editor-last=Ragsdale |title=Imperial Russian Foreign Policy |publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press.

== Format ==
The negotiations took place in a private and almost informal setting. It is significant that the results of the meeting were not written down, so that the Austrian and Russian view of what was agreed on differed significantly. There was neither a signed formal convention nor even a signed protocol. The minutes were dictated separately by both Andrassy and by Gorchakov suggesting that neither side really trusted the other side. The extent of agreed Austrian annexation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has remained controversial. It was these inconsistencies that necessitated further discussions at the Constantinople Conference and the subsequent [[Budapest Convention 1877|Budapest Convention]], though these largely confirmed or amended the Reichstadt discussions.

== Terms of the agreement ==
The Balkan Christians would gain a measure of independence.

Austria would allow Russia to make gains in [[Bessarabia]] and the [[Caucasus]].

Russia would allow Austria to gain [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].

Russia and Austria agree not to create a big Slavic state in the Balkans.

== Implications ==
This effectively meant that Austria was assuring Russia that to stay out of a war between Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It also meant that the Austrians and the Russians were agreeing on how the [[Balkans]] would be split up in the case of a Russian victory.

The '''Three Caesars' Alliance''' or '''Union of the Three Emperors''' ({{lang-de|Dreikaiserbund}}, {{lang-ru|Союз трёх императоров}}) was an alliance between the [[German Empire|German]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]s, from 1873 to 1887. Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] took full charge of German foreign policy from 1870 to his dismissal in 1890.  His goal was a peaceful Europe, based on the balance of power.  Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria, France and Russia would crush Germany.  If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands.  The solution was to ally with two of the three.  In 1873 he formed the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance of the Kaiser of Germany, the Tsar of Russia, and the Kaiser of Austria-Hungary.  Together they would control [[Eastern Europe]], making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept in control.  It aimed at neutralizing the rivalry between Germany’s two neighbors by an agreement over their respective spheres of influence in the Balkans and at isolating Germany’s enemy, France. The Balkans posed a more serious issue, and Bismarck's solution was to give Austria predominance in the western areas, and Russia in the eastern areas.<ref>Raymond James Sontag, ''European Diplomatic History: 1871–1932''  (1933) pp. 3–58</ref>

The first League of the Three Emperors was in effect from 1873 to 1878. A second one was established June 18, 1881, and lasted for three years. It was renewed in 1884 but lapsed in 1887. Both alliances ended because of continued strong conflicts of interest between Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans. The second treaty provided that no territorial changes should take place in the Balkans without prior agreement and that Austria could annex Bosnia and Herzegovina when it wished; in the event of war between one party and a great power not party to the treaty, the other two parties were to maintain friendly neutrality.

Bismarck was able temporarily to preserve the tie with Russia in the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] of 1887; but, after his dismissal, this treaty was not renewed, and a Franco-Russian alliance developed.<ref>"Dreikaiserbund". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.

== First agreement (1873) ==
[[File:Otto von Bismarck.JPG|thumb|100px|right|187px|Bismarck]]
On 22 October 1873, Bismarck negotiated an agreement between the monarchs of [[Austria–Hungary]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[German Empire|Germany]]. The alliance sought to resurrect the [[Holy Alliance]] of 1815 and act as a bulwark against radical sentiments that the conservative rulers found unsettling.<ref>[[#refGildea2003|Gildea 2003]], p. 237.</ref> It was preceded by the [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]] Convention, signed by Russia and Austria–Hungary on 6 June 1873.

== Policy ==

Bismarck often led the League as it assessed challenges, centred on maintaining the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] among the states involved and Europe at large. The cornerstone of his political philosophy included preserving the status quo and avoiding war. Despite German victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-1871, violence remained fresh in the new state's memory and made Germany reluctant to antagonize France but keen as ever to limit its power.

According to the coalition, radical socialist bodies like the [[First International]] represented one of the other key threats to regional stability and dominance. The League actively opposed the expansion of its influence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Ruth Beatrice|title=The Origins of the First World War|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-26185-6|page=3}}</ref>

The League also met crisis in the [[Eastern Europe]], where [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] unrest elicited violent reaction from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces there, which, in turn, met with horror from observing states. The account of the insurrection from an Englishman, Sir [[Edwin Pears]],<ref>Sir Edwin Pears, Forty Years in Constantinople, 1873–1915, (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1916), pp. 16–19, reprinted in Alfred J. Bannan and Achilles Edelenyi, eds., Documentary History of Eastern Europe, (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1970), pp. 191–94. found at [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1876massacre-bulgaria.html], last visited June 24, 2011</ref> describes the gruesome atrocities and reveals British surprise at their extent.

== First dissolution (1878) ==

The collective initially disbanded in 1878 over territorial disputes in the [[Balkans]] as Austria-Hungary feared that Russian support for [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] might ultimately ignite irredentist passions in the [[Slav]] populations.<ref name="Gildea03pg240">[[#refGildea2003|Gildea 2003]], p. 240.</ref> Russian authorities, likewise, feared insurrection if a [[Pan-Slavist]] movement gained too much clout.<ref name="Gildea03pg240"/>

The body’s first conclusion in 1879 gave way to the defensive [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]] between Austria-Hungary and Germany to counter potential Russian aggression. In 1882, [[Italy]] joined the agreement to form the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].<ref>[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=1860]</ref>

==Revival (1881–1887)==

The 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] made Russia feel cheated of its gains of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]. Its key role in European diplomacy was not, however, forgotten by Bismarck. A more formal Three Emperors' Alliance was concluded on 18 June 1881.<ref>[https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Three_Emperors%27_League Text of the actual agreement], last visited Oct. 29, 2018</ref>

It lasted for three years and was renewed at [[Skierniewice]] in 1884 but lapsed in 1887. Both alliances ended because of conflicts between Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans. To preserve a common understanding with Russia, Germany signed the mutual [[Reinsurance Treaty]] in 1887.

In [[diplomatic history]], the "'''Eastern Question'''" refers to the strategic competition and political considerations of the European [[Great Powers]] in light of the political and economic instability in the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the late 18th to early 20th centuries. Characterized as the "[[sick man of Europe]]", the relative weakening of the empire's military strength in the second half of the eighteenth century threatened to undermine the fragile [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] system largely shaped by the [[Concert of Europe]]. The Eastern Question encompassed myriad interrelated elements: Ottoman military defeats, Ottoman institutional insolvency, the ongoing Ottoman political and economic modernization programme, the rise of ethno-religious nationalism in its provinces, and Great Power rivalries.<ref>Theophilus C. Prousis. Review of Macfie, A. L., ''The Eastern Question, 1774-1923''. HABSBURG, H-Net Reviews. December, 1996. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=712]</ref>

The origin of the Eastern Question is normally dated to 1774, when the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]] ended in defeat for the Ottomans. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire was believed to be imminent, the European powers engaged in a power struggle to safeguard their military, strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. [[Imperial Russia]] stood to benefit from the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]]; on the other hand, [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[History of the United Kingdom|Great Britain]] deemed the preservation of the Empire to be in their best interests. The Eastern Question was put to rest after [[World War I]], one of the outcomes of which was the [[collapse of the Ottoman Empire|collapse and division of the Ottoman holdings]].
 
==Background==
{{main article|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|300px|At the height of its power (1683), the [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled territory in the Near East and North Africa, as well as Central and Southeastern Europe.]]

The Eastern Question emerged as the power of the Ottoman Empire began to decline during the 18th century. The Ottomans were at the height of their power in 1683, when they lost the [[Battle of Vienna]] to the combined forces of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Austria, under the command of [[John III Sobieski]]. Peace was made much later, in 1699, with the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]], which forced the Ottoman Empire to cede many of its Central European possessions, including those portions of Hungary which it had occupied. Its westward expansion arrested, the Ottoman Empire never again posed a serious threat to Austria, which became the dominant power in its region of Europe. The Eastern Question did not truly develop until the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish Wars]] of the 18th century.

==Napoleonic Era==
{{main article|Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09)}}
[[File:Athosbattle.jpg|thumb|300px|''Russian Fleet after the [[Battle of Athos]]'', by [[Aleksey Bogolyubov]] (1824–96)]]

The Napoleonic era (1799–1815) brought some relief to the faltering Ottoman Empire. It distracted Russia from further advances. [[Napoleon I]] himself invaded Egypt, but his army was trapped there when the British sank the French fleet. A peace interlude in 1803 allowed the army to return to France.<ref>Juan Cole, ''Napoleon's Egypt: Invading the Middle East'' (2008)</ref>

To secure his own domination and to render the rest of Europe virtually powerless, Napoleon established an alliance with Russia by concluding the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807. Russia undertook to aid Napoleon in his war against Britain; in turn, the Emperor of Russia would receive the Ottoman territories of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. If the Sultan refused to surrender these territories, France and Russia were to attack the Empire, and the Ottoman domains in Europe were to be partitioned between the two allies.<ref>Michael S. Anderson, ''The Eastern Question, 1774–1923: A Study in International Relations'' (1966) ch 1</ref>

The Napoleonic scheme threatened not only the Sultan, but also Britain, Austria and Prussia, which was almost powerless in the face of such a potent alliance. The alliance naturally proved accommodating to the Austrians, who hoped that a joint Franco-Russian attack, which would probably have utterly devastated the Ottoman Empire, could be prevented by diplomacy; but if diplomatic measures failed, the Austrian minister [[Klemens von Metternich]] decided that he would support the partition of the Ottoman Empire—a solution disadvantageous to Austria, but not as dangerous as a complete Russian takeover of Southeastern Europe.

An attack on the Empire, however, did not come to pass, and the alliance concluded at Tilsit was dissolved by the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812. Following Napoleon's defeat by the Great Powers in 1815, representatives of the victors met at the [[Congress of Vienna]], but failed to take any action relating to the territorial integrity of the decaying Ottoman Empire. This omission, together with the exclusion of the Sultan from the [[Holy Alliance]], was interpreted by many as supportive of the position that the Eastern Question was a Russian domestic issue that did not concern any other European nations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter Alison Phillips|title=The confederation of Europe: a study of the European alliance, 1813–1823, as an experiment in the international organization of peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2BJAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA234|year=1914|publisher=Longmans, Green|pages=234–50}}</ref>

==Serbian revolution==
{{See also|Serbian revolution|}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Uprising.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The takeover of [[Belgrade]], 1806]] -->
'''Serbian revolution''' or ''Revolutionary Serbia'' refers to the [[Révolution nationale|national]] and [[social revolution]] of the [[Serbs|Serbian people]] between 1804 and 1815, during which Serbia managed to fully emancipate from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and exist as a sovereign European [[nation-state]], and a latter period (1815–1833), marked by intense negotiations between [[Belgrade]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]. The term was invented by a famous German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] in his book ''Die Serbische Revolution'', published in 1829.<ref>Leopold von Ranke, ''A History of Serbia and the Serbian Revolution'' (1847)</ref> These events marked the foundation of [[Principality of Serbia|modern Serbia]].<ref>L. S. Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'' (London: Hurst and Co., 2000), p. 248-250.</ref> While the first phase of the revolution (1804–1815) was in fact a war of independence, the second phase (1815–1833) resulted in official recognition of a [[Principality of Serbia|suzerain Serbian state]] by the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] (the Ottoman government), thus bringing the revolution to its end.<ref>For an overview see Wayne S. Vucinich, "Marxian Interpretations of the First Serbian Revolution." ''Journal of Central European Affairs''  (1961) 21#1: 3–14.</ref>

The revolution took place by stages:  the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804–13), led by [[Karađorđe Petrović]]; [[Hadži Prodanova buna|Hadži Prodan's revolt]] (1814); the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] (1815) under [[Miloš Obrenović]]; and official recognition of the Serbian state (1815–1833) by the Porte.

''[[The Proclamation]]'' (1809) by [[Karađorđe]] in the capital [[Belgrade]] represented the peak of the revolution. It called for unity of the [[Serbs|Serbian nation]], emphasizing the importance of freedom of religion, [[Serbian history]] and formal, written rules of law, all of which it claimed the [[Ottoman Empire]] had failed to provide. It also called on Serbs to stop paying the [[Jizya|jizya tax]] to the Porte.

The ultimate result of the uprisings was Serbia's [[suzerainty]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Principality of Serbia]] was established, governed by its own Parliament, Government, Constitution and its own royal dynasty.  Social element of the revolution was achieved through introduction of the bourgeois society values in Serbia, which is why it was considered the world's easternmost bourgeois revolt, which culminated with the abolition of [[feudalism]] in 1806.<ref>http://www.nb.rs/view_file.php?file_id=57</ref> The establishment of the [[Miloš Obrenović#Later rule|first constitution in the Balkans]] in 1835 ([[Miloš Obrenović#Later rule|later abolished]]) and the founding in 1808 of its first university, [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade's Great Academy]], added to the achievements of the young Serb state.<ref>[http://www.bg.ac.rs/en_istorijat.php University of Belgrade<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> By 1833, Serbia was officially recognized as a tributary to the Ottoman Empire and as such, acknowledged as a hereditary monarchy.

==Greek Revolt==
{{main article|Greek War of Independence|Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)}}
[[File:Vasilika.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Vassilika]] in 1821 marked an early turning point in the war.]]
The Eastern Question once again became a major European issue when the [[Greece|Greeks]] declared independence from the Sultan in 1821. It was at about this time that the phrase "Eastern Question" was coined. Ever since the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, there had been rumours that the Emperor of Russia sought to invade the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek Revolt seemed to make an invasion even more likely. The British foreign minister, [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh]], as well as the Austrian foreign minister, Metternich, counselled the Emperor of Russia, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], not to enter the war. Instead, they pleaded that he maintain the [[Concert of Europe]] (the spirit of broad collaboration in Europe which had persisted since Napoleon's defeat). A desire for peaceful co-operation was also held by Alexander I, who had founded the Holy Alliance. Rather than immediately putting the Eastern Question to rest by aiding the Greeks and attacking the Ottomans, Alexander wavered, ultimately failing to take any decisive action.

Alexander's death in 1825 brought [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] to the Imperial Throne of Russia. Deciding that he would no longer tolerate negotiations and conferences, he chose to intervene in Greece.  Britain also soon became involved, interested in imposing its will on a newly formed Greek state in part to prevent it becoming a wholly Russian vassal. The spirit of [[Romanticism]] that then dominated Western European cultural life also made support for Greek independence politically viable.  France too aligned itself with the Greeks, but Austria (still worried about Russian expansion) did not. Outraged by the interference of the Great Powers, the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], denounced Russia as an enemy of [[Islam]], prompting Russia to declare war in 1828. An alarmed Austria sought to form an anti-Russian coalition, but its attempts were in vain.

As the war continued into 1829, Russia gained a firm advantage over the Ottoman Empire. By prolonging hostilities further, however, Russia would have invited Austria to enter the war against her and would have resulted in considerable suspicion in Britain. Therefore, for the Russians to continue with the war in hopes of destroying the Ottoman Empire would have been inexpedient.  At this stage, the King of France, [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], proposed the partition of the Ottoman Empire among Austria, Russia and others, but his scheme was presented too belatedly to produce a result.

Thus, Russia was able to secure neither a decisive defeat nor a partition of the Ottoman Empire. She chose, however, to adopt the policy of degrading the Ottoman Empire to a mere dependency. In 1829, the Emperor of Russia concluded the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] with the Sultan; his empire was granted additional territory along the Black Sea, Russian commercial vessels were granted access to the [[Dardanelles]], and the commercial rights of Russians in the Ottoman Empire were enhanced. The Greek War of Independence was terminated shortly thereafter, as Greece was granted independence by the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] in 1832.

==Muhammad Ali of Egypt==
{{main article|Muhammad Ali of Egypt}}
[[Image:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|right|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]]]]
Just as the Greek Revolt was coming to an end, a conflict broke out in the Ottoman Empire between the Sultan and his nominal [[viceroy]] in [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehmet Ali]]. The modern and well trained Egyptians looked as though they could conquer the entire empire.  The Tsar of Russia, in keeping with his policy of reducing the Ottoman Sultan to a petty vassal, offered to form an alliance with the Sultan. In 1833, the two rulers negotiated the [[Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi]], in which Russia achieved the aim of securing complete dominance over the Ottomans. The Russians pledged to protect the Empire from external attacks; in turn, the Sultan pledged to close the Dardanelles to warships whenever Russia was at war. This provision of the Treaty raised a problem known as the "Straits Question". The agreement provided for the closure for all warships, but many European statesmen mistakenly believed that the clause allowed Russian vessels. Britain and France were angered by the misinterpreted clause; they also sought to contain Russian expansion. The two kingdoms, however, differed on how to achieve their objective; the British wished to uphold the Sultan, but the French preferred to make Muhammad Ali (whom they saw as more competent) the ruler of the entire Ottoman Empire. Russian intervention led the Sultan to negotiate a peace with Muhammad Ali in 1833, but war broke out once again in 1839.<ref>Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad ‘Ali'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967)</ref>

Sultan Mahmud II died the same year, leaving the Ottoman Empire to his son [[Abdulmejid I]] in a critical state: the Ottoman army had been significantly defeated by the forces of Muhammad Ali. Another disaster followed when the entire Turkish fleet was seized by the Egyptian forces. Great Britain and Russia now intervened to prevent the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but France still continued to support Muhammad Ali. In 1840, however, the Great Powers agreed to compromise; Muhammad Ali agreed to make a nominal act of submission to the Sultan, but was granted hereditary control of Egypt.

The only unresolved issue of the period was the Straits Question. In 1841, Russia consented to the abrogation of the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi by accepting the [[London Straits Convention]]. The Great Powers — Russia, Britain, France, Austria and Prussia — agreed to the re-establishment of the "ancient rule" of the Ottoman Empire, which provided that the Turkish straits would be closed to all warships whatsoever, with the exception of the Sultan's allies during wartime.  With the Straits Convention, the Russian Emperor Nicholas I abandoned the idea of reducing the Sultan to a state of dependence, and returned to the plan of partitioning Ottoman territories in Europe.

Thus, after the resolution of the Egyptian struggle which had begun in 1831, the weak Ottoman Empire was no longer wholly dependent on Russia but was dependent on the Great Powers for protection. Attempts at internal reform failed to end the decline of the Empire. By the 1840s, the Ottoman Empire had become the "[[sick man of Europe]]", and its eventual dissolution appeared inevitable.

==Revolutions of 1848==
{{main article|Revolutions of 1848}}
After the Great Powers reached a compromise to end the revolt of Mehmet Ali, the Eastern Question lay dormant for about a decade until revived by the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Although Russia could have seized the opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire—France and Austria were at the time occupied by their own insurrections—it chose not to. Instead, Emperor Nicholas committed his troops to the defence of Austria, hoping to establish goodwill to allow him to seize Ottoman possessions in Europe later.

After the Austrian Revolution was suppressed, an Austro-Russian war against the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent. The Emperors of both Austria and Russia demanded that the Sultan return Austrian rebels who had sought asylum in the Empire, but he refused. The indignant monarchs withdrew their ambassadors to the [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]], threatening armed conflict. Almost immediately, however, Britain and France sent their fleets to protect the Ottoman Empire. The two Emperors, deeming military hostilities futile, withdrew their demands for the surrender of the fugitives.  The short crisis created a closer relationship between Britain and France, which led to a joint war against Russia in the Crimean War of 1853–56.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 33–35</ref>

==Crimean War==
{{main article|Crimean War}}
A new conflict began during the 1850s with a religious dispute. Under treaties negotiated during the 18th century, France was the guardian of Roman Catholics in the Ottoman Empire, while Russia was the protector of Orthodox Christians. For several years, however, Catholic and Orthodox monks had disputed possession of the [[Church of the Nativity]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. During the early 1850s, the two sides made demands which the Sultan could not possibly satisfy simultaneously. In 1853, the Sultan adjudicated in favour of the French, despite the vehement protestations of the local Orthodox monks.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''Crimea: The Last Crusade'' (2010); also published as ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2010)
</ref>

Emperor Nicholas of Russia dispatched [[Aleksandr Sergeyevich Menshikov|Prince Menshikov]], on a special mission to the Porte. By previous treaties, the Sultan was committed "to protect the Christian religion and its Churches", but Menshikov tried to negotiate a new treaty, under which Russia would be allowed to interfere whenever it deemed the Sultan's protection inadequate. At the same time, however, the British government sent [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe]], who learnt of Menshikov's demands upon arriving. Through skillful diplomacy, Lord Stratford convinced the Sultan to reject the treaty, which compromised the independence of the Ottomans. Shortly after he learned of the failure of Menshikov's diplomacy, Nicholas marched into Moldavia and Wallachia (Ottoman principalities in which Russia was acknowledged as a special guardian of the Orthodox Church), with the pretext that the Sultan failed to resolve the issue of the Holy Places. Nicholas believed that the European powers would not object strongly to the annexation of a few neighbouring Ottoman provinces, especially given Russian involvement in suppressing the Revolutions of 1848.

Britain, seeking to maintain the security of the Ottoman Empire, sent a fleet to the Dardanelles, where it was joined by another fleet sent by France. Yet the European powers hoped for a diplomatic compromise. The representatives of the four neutral Great Powers—Britain, France, Austria and Prussia—met in [[Vienna]], where they drafted a note which they hoped would be acceptable to Russia and the Empire. The note was approved by Nicolas but rejected by Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I, who felt that the document's poor phrasing left it open to many interpretations. Britain, France and Austria were united in proposing amendments to mollify the Sultan, but their suggestions were ignored in the Court of [[Saint Petersburg]]. Britain and France set aside the idea of continuing negotiations, but Austria and Prussia held hope for diplomacy despite the rejection of the proposed amendments. The Sultan proceeded to war, his armies attacking the Russian army near the Danube. Nicholas responded by despatching warships, which destroyed the entire Ottoman fleet at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinop]] on 30 November 1853, allowing Russia to land and supply its forces on the Ottoman shores fairly easily. The destruction of the Ottoman fleet and the threat of Russian expansion alarmed both Britain and France, who stepped forth in defence of the Ottoman Empire. In 1854, after Russia ignored an Anglo-French ultimatum to withdraw from the Danubian Principalities, Britain and France declared war.

Emperor Nicholas I presumed that Austria, in return for the support rendered during the Revolutions of 1848, would side with him, or at the very least remain neutral. However, Austria felt threatened by the Russian troops in the nearby Danubian Principalities. When Britain and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Principalities, Austria supported them; and, though it did not immediately declare war on Russia, it refused to guarantee its neutrality. When, in the summer of 1854, Austria made another demand for the withdrawal of troops, Russia (fearing that Austria would enter the war) complied.

Though the original grounds for war were lost when Russia withdrew her troops from the Danubian Principalities, Britain and France continued hostilities. Determined to address the Eastern Question by ending the Russian threat to the Ottoman Empire, the allies posed several conditions for a ceasefire, including that Russia should give up its protectorate over the Danubian Principalities; that Russia should abandon any right to interfere in Ottoman affairs on the behalf of Orthodox Christians; that the Straits Convention of 1841 was to be revised; and finally, all nations were to be granted access to the river Danube. As the Emperor refused to comply with these "Four Points", the [[Crimean War]] proceeded.

Peace negotiations began in 1856 under the Emperor Nicholas I's successor, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Under the ensuing [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the "Four Points" plan proposed earlier was largely adhered to; most notably, Russia's special privileges relating to the Danubian Principalities were transferred to the Great Powers as a group. In addition, warships of all nations were perpetually excluded from the Black Sea, once the home to a Russian fleet (which had been destroyed during the war). The Emperor of Russia and the Sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on that sea coast. The Black Sea clauses came at a tremendous disadvantage to Russia, for it greatly diminished the naval threat it posed to the Ottomans. Moreover, all the Great Powers pledged to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire.

The Treaty of Paris stood until 1871, when France was crushed in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. While Prussia and several other German states united into a powerful [[German Empire]], [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] was deposed in the formation of the [[French Third Republic]]. Napoleon had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question in order to gain the support of Britain. But the new French Republic did not oppose Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire because that did not significantly threaten French interests. Encouraged by the decision of France, and supported by the German minister [[Otto von Bismarck|Otto, Fürst von Bismarck]], Russia denounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As Britain alone could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a fleet in the Black Sea.

==Great Eastern Crisis (1875–78)==
{{main article|Great Eastern Crisis}}
{{see also|Herzegovina uprising (1875–1877)|April Uprising|Constantinople Conference|Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878}}

Britain, France, and Austria opposed the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] because the Ottoman Empire gave Russia too much influence in the [[Balkans]], where insurrections were frequent. After many attempts, a diplomatic settlement was reached at the [[Congress of Berlin]], and the new [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] revised the earlier treaty. Germany's [[Otto von Bismarck]] presided over the Congress, acting as an "honest broker".<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848–1918 (1954) pp 228–54</ref>

In 1875, the territory of [[Herzegovina]] rebelled against the Sultan, in the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]] in the Province of Bosnia, and Bulgaria rebelled in the [[April Uprising]]. The Great Powers believed they should intervene to prevent a bloody war in the Balkans. The first to act were the members of the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), whose common attitude toward the Eastern Question was embodied in the Andrassy Note (named for the Hungarian diplomat [[Julius Andrassy|Julius, Count Andrassy]]). The Note, seeking to avoid a widespread conflagration in Southeastern Europe, urged the Sultan to institute various reforms, including granting religious liberty to Christians. A joint commission of Christians and Muslims was to be established to ensure the enactment of appropriate reforms. With the approval of Britain and France, the Note was submitted to the Sultan, and he agreed on 31 January 1876. But the Herzegovinian leaders rejected the proposal, pointing out that the Sultan had already failed his promises of reforms.

Representatives of the Three Emperors met again in Berlin, where they approved the [[Berlin Memorandum]]. To convince the Herzegovinians, the Memorandum suggested that international representatives be allowed to oversee the institution of reforms in the rebelling provinces. But before the Memorandum could be approved by the Porte, the Ottoman Empire was convulsed by internal strife, which led to the deposition of Sultan Abdul-Aziz. The new Sultan, [[Murad V]], was himself deposed three months later due to his mental instability, bringing [[Abdul Hamid II]] to power. In the meantime, the hardships of the Ottomans had increased; their treasury was empty, and they faced insurrections not only in Herzegovina and Bulgaria, but also in [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Still, the Ottoman Empire managed to crush the insurgents in August 1876. The result incommoded Russia, which had planned to take possession of various Ottoman territories in Southeastern Europe in the course of the conflict.

After the uprisings were largely suppressed, however, rumours of Ottoman atrocities against the rebellious population shocked European sensibilities. Russia now intended to enter the war on the side of the rebels. Another attempt for peace was made by delegates of the Great Powers (who now numbered six due to the rise of Italy) assembled at the [[Constantinople Conference]] in 1876. However, the Sultan refused to allow international representatives to oversee the reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1877, the Great Powers again made proposals to the Ottoman Empire which were rejected.

[[File:SouthEast Europe 1878.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|South-East Europe after the [[Congress of Berlin]], 1878]]

Russia declared war on 24 April 1877. Its chancellor [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] had effectively secured Austrian neutrality with the [[Reichstadt Agreement]], under which Ottoman territories captured in the course of the war would be partitioned between the Russian and Austria-Hungarian Empires, with the latter obtaining Bosnia and Herzegovina. Britain, though still fearing the Russian threat to British dominance in Southern Asia, did not involve itself in the conflict. However, when Russia threatened to conquer Constantinople, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] urged Austria and Germany to ally with him against this war aim. As a result, Russia sued for peace through the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which stipulated independence to Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro, autonomy to Bulgaria, reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the ceding [[Dobruja]] and parts of [[Armenia]] and a large indemnity to Russia. This would give Russia great influence in Southeastern Europe, as it could dominate the newly independent states. To reduce these advantages to Russia, the Great Powers (especially Britain), insisted that the treaty be heavily revised.

At the [[Congress of Berlin]], the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] adjusted the boundaries of the new states in the Ottoman Empire's favour. Bulgaria was divided into two states (Bulgaria and [[Eastern Rumelia]]), as it was feared that a single state would be susceptible to Russian domination. Ottoman cessions to Russia were largely sustained. Bosnia and Herzegovina, though still nominally within the Ottoman Empire, were transferred to [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austrian control]]. The Ottoman island of [[Cyprus]] was given to Britain via a secret agreement between Britain and the Ottoman Empire. These final two procedures were predominantly forced by Disraeli, who was famously described by [[Otto von Bismarck]] as "The old Jew, that is the man", after his level-headed Palmerstonian approach to the Eastern Question.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Concise Dictionary of Foreign Quotations |last=Lejeune |first=Anthony |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=1-57958-341-5 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KLz2QEdQaoC&pg=PA139 |accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>

==Germany and the Ottoman Empire==
{{Further|Baghdad Railway}}
Germany drew away from Russia and became closer to Austria-Hungary, with whom she concluded the [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]] in 1879. Germany also closely allied with the Ottoman Empire. Germany took over the re-organisation of the Ottoman military and financial system; in return, it received several commercial concessions, including permission to build the [[Baghdad Railway]], which secured for them access to several important economic markets and had the potential for German entry into the Persian Gulf area controlled by Britain. Germany was driven not only by commercial interests, but also by an imperialistic and militaristic rivalry with Britain.  Meanwhile Britain agreed to the [[Entente Cordiale]] with France in 1904, thereby resolving differences between the two countries over international affairs. Britain also reconciled with Russia in 1907 with the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]].<ref>Sean McMeekin, ''The Berlin-Baghdad Express: The Ottoman Empire and Germany's Bid for World Power'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Berlin-Baghdad-Express-Ottoman-Empire-Germanys/dp/0674064321/  excerpt and text search]</ref>

==Young Turk Revolution==
{{main article|Young Turk Revolution}}

In April 1908, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (more commonly called the [[Young Turks]]), a political party opposed to the despotic rule of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], led [[Young Turk Revolution|a rebellion against the Sultan]]. The pro-reform Young Turks deposed the Sultan by July 1909, replacing him with the ineffective [[Mehmed V]]. This began the [[Second Constitutional Era]] of the Ottoman Empire.

In the following years, various constitutional and political reforms were instituted, but the decay of the Ottoman Empire continued.

==Bosnian Crisis==
{{main article|Bosnian crisis}}

In October 1908, Austria-Hungary's plans for the [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were opposed by Serbia, which sought Russian assistance. Russia, however, could not comply; a defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] had devastated her, and Germany threatened to support Austria-Hungary during a war. Britain and France, who were not directly concerned by the annexation, did not become involved. Thus unaided, Serbia was forced to renounce her opposition to the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

== Name ==
{{Main|Names of the Ottoman Empire}}
The word ''Ottoman'' is a historical [[anglicisation]] of the name of [[Osman I]], the founder of the Empire and of the ruling [[Ottoman dynasty|House of Osman]] (also known as the Ottoman dynasty). Osman's name in turn was the Turkish form of the Arabic name ''[[Uthman (name)|ʿUthmān]]'' ({{lang|ota-Arab|عثمان}}). In [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], the empire was referred to as ''Devlet-i ʿAlīye-yi ʿO<u>s</u>mānīye'' ({{lang|ota-Arab|دولت عليه عثمانیه}}),<ref name="twareekh.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.twareekh.com/images/upload/aboutus/ottmani10liras1334F-.jpg |title=Ottoman banknote with Arabic script |accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> (literally "The Supreme Ottoman State") or alternatively ''ʿO<u>s</u>mānlı Devleti'' ({{lang|ota-Arab|عثمانلى دولتى}}). In [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]], it is known as ''Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'' ("The Ottoman Empire") or ''Osmanlı Devleti'' ("The Ottoman State").

The Turkish word for "Ottoman" (''Osmanlı'') originally referred to the tribal followers of Osman in the fourteenth century, and subsequently came to be used to refer to the empire's military-administrative elite. In contrast, the term "Turk" (''Türk'') was used to refer to the Anatolian peasant and tribal population, and was seen as a disparaging term when applied to urban, educated individuals.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ágoston |first=Gábor |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Introduction |date=2009 |page=xxvi}}

The term ''Rūmī'' was also used to refer to Turkish-speakers by the other Muslim peoples of the empire and beyond.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |title=A Rome of One's Own: Cultural Geography and Identity in the Lands of Rum |journal=Muqarnas |volume=24 |date=2007 |page=11}}</ref>

In Western Europe, the two names "Ottoman Empire" and "Turkey" were often used interchangeably, with "Turkey" being increasingly favoured both in formal and informal situations. This dichotomy was officially ended in 1920–23, when the newly established Ankara-based Turkish government chose [[Turkey]] as the sole official name. Most scholarly historians avoid the terms "Turkey", "Turks", and "Turkish" when referring to the Ottomans, due to the empire's multinational character.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=Soucek |first=Svat |title=Ottoman Maritime Wars, 1416–1700 |publisher=The Isis Press |place=Istanbul |date=2015 |isbn=978-975-428-554-3 |pages=8 |quote=The scholarly community specializing in Ottoman studies has of late virtually banned the use of "Turkey", "Turks", and "Turkish" from acceptable vocabulary, declaring "Ottoman" and its expanded use mandatory and permitting its "Turkish" rival only in linguistic and philological contexts.}}</ref>

As the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rum]] declined in the 13th century, Anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent Turkish principalities known as the [[Anatolian Beyliks]]. One of these beyliks, in the region of [[Bithynia]] on the frontier of the [[Byzantine Empire]], was led by the Turkish tribal leader [[Osman I|Osman]] (d. 1323/4), a figure of obscure origins from whom the name Ottoman is derived.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kermeli |first=Eugenia  |editor-last=Ágoston |editor-first=Gábor |editor2=Bruce Masters |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |chapter=Osman I |date=2009 |page=444}}</ref> Osman's early followers consisted both of Turkish tribal groups and Byzantine renegades, many but not all converts to Islam.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lowry |first=Heath |title=The Nature of the Early Ottoman State |publisher=SUNY Press |date=2003 |page=59}}

In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over Anatolia and the [[History of the Balkans|Balkans]]. Osman's son, [[Orhan]], captured the northwestern Anatolian city of [[Bursa]] in 1326, making it the new capital of the Ottoman state and supplanting Byzantine control in the region. The important port city of [[Thessaloniki]] was captured from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in 1387 and sacked. The Ottoman victory at [[Battle of Kosovo|Kosovo in 1389]] effectively marked [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|the end of Serbian power]] in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Kosova|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fnbw1wsacSAC&pg=PA95|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=95–96|isbn=978-0-8108-5309-6}}</ref> The [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale [[Crusades|crusade]] of the [[Middle Ages]], failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Nicolle|title=Nicopolis 1396: The Last Crusade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hUst0z-oEQC|year=1999|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-85532-918-8}}</ref>

As the Turks expanded into the Balkans, the [[Sieges of Constantinople#Ottoman Sieges|conquest of Constantinople]] became a crucial objective. The Ottomans had already wrested control of nearly all former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine lands]] surrounding the city, but the heavy defence of Constantinople's strategic position on the [[Bosphorus]] Strait made it difficult to conquer. In 1402, the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the [[Turco-Mongol]] leader [[Timur]], founder of the [[Timurid Empire]], invaded Ottoman Anatolia from the east. In the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan [[Bayezid I]] as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The [[Ottoman Interregnum|ensuing civil war]], also known as the ''Fetret Devri'', lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when [[Mehmed I]] emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA363|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=363|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7}}</ref>

The Balkan territories lost by the Ottomans after 1402, including Thessaloniki, Macedonia and Kosovo, were later recovered by [[Murad II]] between the 1430s and 1450s. On 10 November 1444, Murad repelled the [[Crusade of Varna]] by defeating the Hungarian, Polish, and [[Wallachia]]n armies under [[Władysław III of Poland]] (also King of Hungary) and [[John Hunyadi]] at the [[Battle of Varna]], although Albanians under [[Skanderbeg]] continued to resist. Four years later, John Hunyadi prepared another army of Hungarian and Wallachian forces to attack the Turks, but was again defeated at the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] in 1448.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mesut Uyar|author2=Edward J.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ottoman Empire entered a [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|period of expansion]]. The Empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultans]].

The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly.

Despite the growing European presence in the Indian Ocean, Ottoman trade with the east continued to flourish. Cairo in particular benefitted from the rise of Yemeni coffee as a popular consumer commodity. As coffeehouses appeared in cities and towns across the empire, Cairo developed into a major center for its trade, contributing to its continued prosperity throughout the seventeenth and much of the eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya |editor-last=İnalcık |editor-first=Halil |editor2=Donald Quataert |title=An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1914 |volume=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |pages=507–8 |chapter=Crisis and Change, 1590–1699 |isbn=0-521-57456-0}}</ref>

[[Expansion of Russia 1500–1800|Russian expansion]], however, presented a large and growing threat.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p = 371}} Accordingly, King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] was welcomed as an ally in the Ottoman Empire following his defeat by the Russians at the [[Battle of Poltava]] of 1709 in central Ukraine (part of the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700–1721).{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p = 371}} Charles XII persuaded the Ottoman Sultan [[Ahmed III]] to declare war on Russia, which resulted in an Ottoman victory in the [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1710–1711, in Moldavia.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p = 372}}

After the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718]] the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] confirmed the loss of the [[Banat]], Serbia and [[Oltenia|"Little Walachia" (Oltenia)]] to Austria. The Treaty also revealed that the Ottoman Empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in Europe.{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p = 376}} The [[Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–1739)|Austro-Russian–Turkish War]] (1735–1739), which was ended by the [[Treaty of Belgrade]] in 1739, resulted in the recovery of Serbia and Oltenia, but the Empire lost the port of [[Azov]], north of the Crimean Peninsula, to the Russians. After this treaty the Ottoman Empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace, as Austria and Russia were forced to deal with the rise of [[Prussia]].{{sfn|Kinross|1979|p = 392}}

In 1768 Russian-backed Ukrainian [[Haidamaka]]s, pursuing Polish confederates, entered [[Balta, Ukraine|Balta]], an Ottoman-controlled town on the border of Bessarabia in Ukraine, and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground. This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774]].

[[Selim III]] (1789–1807) made the first major attempts to [[Ottoman military reform efforts|modernize the army]], but his reforms were hampered by the religious leadership and the [[Janissary]] corps.

Selim's efforts cost him his throne and his life, but were resolved in spectacular and bloody fashion by his successor, the dynamic [[Mahmud II]], who [[The Auspicious Incident|eliminated the Janissary corps]] in 1826.

The [[Serbian revolution]] (1804–1815) marked the beginning of an era of [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|national awakening]] in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Eastern Question]]. In 1811, the fundamentalist Wahhabis of Arabia, led by the al-Saud family revolted against the Ottomans. Unable to defeat the Wahhabi rebels, the Sublime Porte had Mohammad Ali the Great, the ''vali'' (governor) of Egypt tasked with retaking Arabia which ended with the destruction of the [[Emirate of Diriyah]] in 1818.

In 1839, the Sublime Porte attempted to take back what it lost to the de facto independent ''vilayet'' of Egypt, and suffered a crushing defeat, leading to the [[Oriental Crisis of 1840|Oriental Crisis]] as Mohammad Ali was very close to France, and the prospect of him as Sultan was widely viewed as putting the entire empire into the French sphere of influence.<ref name="Karsh, Effraim page 96"/> As the Sublime Porte had proved itself incapable of defeating the Egyptians, Britain and Austria intervened to defeat Egypt.<ref name="Karsh, Effraim page 96"/> By the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire was called the [[Sick man of Europe|"sick man"]] by Europeans.

As the Ottoman state attempted to modernize its infrastructure and army in response to threats from the outside, it also opened itself up to a different kind of threat: that of creditors.

In 1883, a German military mission under General Baron [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Colmar von der Goltz]] arrived to train the Ottoman Army, leading to the so-called "Goltz generation" of German-trained officers who were to play a notable role in the politics of the last years of the empire.<ref>Akmeșe, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 24</ref>

The [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] (1908–1922) began with the [[Second Constitutional Era]], a moment of hope and promise established with the [[Young Turk Revolution]]. It restored the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and brought in [[List of political parties in the Ottoman Empire|multi-party politics]] with a [[Elections in the Ottoman Empire|two-stage electoral system]] ([[Ottoman electoral law|electoral law]]) under the [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman parliament]]. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire’s citizens to modernize the state’s institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers. Its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place.<ref>{{harvnb|Reynolds|2011|p= 1}}</ref> Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire.

Members of [[Young Turks]] movement who had once gone underground now established their parties.<ref>{{Harvard citation|Erickson|2013|p=32}}</ref> Among them “[[Committee of Union and Progress]],” and “[[Freedom and Accord Party]]” were major parties. On the other end of the spectrum were ethnic parties which included [[Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party in Palestine (Poale Zion)|Poale Zion]], [[Al-Fatat]], and [[Armenian national movement]] organized under [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]. Profiting from the civil strife, [[Austria-Hungary]] officially annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908. The last of the [[Census in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman censuses]] was performed in [[1914 population statistics for the Ottoman Empire|1914]]. Despite [[Ottoman military reforms|military reforms]] which reconstituted the [[Ottoman Modern Army]], the Empire lost its North African territories and the Dodecanese in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911) and almost all of its European territories in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913). The Empire faced continuous unrest in the years leading up to [[World War I]], including the [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909]], the [[31 March Incident]] and two further coups in [[1912 Ottoman coup d'état|1912]] and [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|1913]].

The [[history of the Ottoman Empire during World War I]] began with the [[Ottoman entry into World War I|Ottoman surprise attack]] on the Russian Black Sea coast on 29 October 1914. Following the attack, Russia and its allies, France and Britain, declared war on the Ottomans. There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] and the [[Siege of Kut]].

The [[Arab Revolt]] began in 1916 and turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. The [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October 1918, setting the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. This treaty, as designed in the [[Conference of London (1920)|conference of London]], allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. The [[occupation of Constantinople]] and [[occupation of İzmir|İzmir]] led to the establishment of a [[Turkish national movement]], which won the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–23) under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] (later given the surname "Atatürk"). The [[Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate|sultanate was abolished]] on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, [[Mehmed VI]] (reigned 1918–22), left the country on 17 November 1922.

== Historical debate on the origins and nature of the Ottoman state ==
{{main|Gaza Thesis}}
{{one source|section|date=May 2017}}
Several historians such as British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] and the Greek historian Dimitri Kitzikis have argued that after the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman state took over the machinery of the Roman state, and that in essence the Ottoman Empire was a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire under a thin Turkish Islamic guise.<ref>Stone, Norman "Turkey in the Russian Mirror" pages 86–100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark & Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, 2004 pages 92–93</ref> Kitzikis called the Ottoman state "a Greek-Turkish condominium".<ref name="Stone pages 86-100">Stone, Norman "Turkey in the Russian Mirror" pages 86–100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark & Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, 2004 page 93</ref> The American historian [[Speros Vryonis]] wrote that the Ottoman state was centered on "a Byzantine-Balkan base with a veneer of the Turkish language and the Islamic religion".<ref name="Stone pages 86-100"/> Other historians have followed the lead of the Austrian historian [[Paul Wittek]] who emphasized the Islamic character of the Ottoman state, seeing the Ottoman state as a "Jihad state" dedicated to expanding the world of Islam.<ref name="Stone pages 86-100"/> Another group of historians led by the Turkish historian M. Fuat Koprulu championed the "''[[Ghazi (warrior)|gazi]]'' thesis" that saw the Ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the [[nomad]]ic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale, and argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia.<ref name="Stone pages 86-100"/> More recently, the American historian [[Heath Lowry]] called the Ottoman state a "predatory confederacy" led in equal parts by Turks and Greeks converted to Islam.<ref name="Stone pages 86-100"/> 
	 
The British historian [[Norman Stone]] suggested many continuities between the Eastern Roman and Ottoman empires such as the ''zeugarion'' tax of Byzantium becoming the Ottoman ''Resm-i çift'' tax, the ''[[pronoia]]'' land-holding system that linked the amount of land one owned with one's ability to raise cavalry becoming the Ottoman ''[[timar]]'' system, and the Ottoman measurement for land the ''donum'' was the same as the Byzantine ''stremma''. Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land ownings in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, Norman "Turkey in the Russian Mirror" pages 86–100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark & Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, 2004 pages 94–95</ref>

Before the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[state organisation of the Ottoman Empire]] was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy. Certain pre-Islamic Turkish traditions that had survived the adoption of administrative and legal practices from Islamic [[Iran]] remained important in Ottoman administrative circles.{{sfn|Itzkowitz|1980|p = 38}} According to Ottoman understanding, the state's primary responsibility was to defend and extend the land of the Muslims and to ensure security and harmony within its borders in the overarching context of [[Sunni|orthodox]] Islamic practice and dynastic sovereignty.<ref name="Kapucu">{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWceNjwTggUC&pg=PA77|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=77}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire, or as a dynastic institution, the [[Ottoman dynasty|House of Osman]], was unprecedented and unequaled in the Islamic world for its size and duration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nspmqLKPU-wC&pg=PA199|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93243-1|page=199}}</ref> In Europe, only the [[House of Habsburg]] had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns (kings/emperors) from the same family who ruled for so long, and during the same period, between the late 13th and early 20th centuries. The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son or nephew) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name="Kapucu"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed VI]] (r. 1918–1922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparallelled in both Europe (e.g. the male line of the [[House of Habsburg]] became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world. The primary purpose of the [[Imperial Harem]] was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the Ottoman throne and secure the continuation of the direct patrilineal (male-line) descendance of the Ottoman sultans.

The highest position in Islam, ''[[caliphate]]'', was claimed by the sultans starting with [[Murad I]],<ref name="Lambton">{{cite book |last1=Lambton |first1=Ann |author-link1=Ann Lambton |last2=Lewis |first2=Bernard |author-link2=Bernard Lewis |title=The Cambridge History of Islam: The Indian sub-continent, South-East Asia, Africa and the Muslim west |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AuJvd2Tyt8C |page=320 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-521-22310-2|access-date=}}</ref> which was established as [[Ottoman Caliphate]]. The Ottoman sultan, ''[[Padishah|pâdişâh]]'' or "lord of kings", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The [[Imperial Harem]] was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the [[Valide Sultan]]. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the "[[Sultanate of the women|Sultanate of Women]]". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan.{{dubious|reason= this is demonstrably not true, just look at any list of sultans |date=September 2016}} The strong educational system of the [[palace school]] was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the [[Madrasa]] (''{{lang-ota|Medrese}}'') was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=Istanbul and the Civilization of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FQRrbUMojcC&pg=PA151|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=1963|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-1060-8|page=151}}</ref> The second track was a free [[boarding school]] for the Christians, the ''[[Enderûn]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Ottoman Palace School Enderun and the Man with Multiple Talents, Matrakçı Nasuh|journal=Journal of the Korea Society of Mathematical Education, Series D|date=March 2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=19–31|url=https://tamu.academia.edu/SencerCorlu/Papers/471488/The_Ottoman_Palace_School_Enderun_and_the_Man_with_Multiple_Talents_Matrakci_Nasuh|series=Research in Mathematical Education}}</ref> which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in [[Rumelia]] or the Balkans, a process known as [[Devshirme in the Ottoman Palace School|Devshirme]] (''{{lang|ota|Devşirme}}'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Karpat|first=Kemal H.|title=Social Change and Politics in Turkey: A Structural-Historical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlhD9SjavRcC&pg=PA204|accessdate=11 February 2013|year=1973|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-03817-2|page=204}}</ref>

Though the sultan was the supreme monarch, the sultan's political and executive authority was delegated. The politics of the state had a number of advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a [[Grand Vizier]] was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name="Black p199"/>

[[File:Yusuf Ziya Paşa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]

Throughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces. The representatives formed the [[Imperial Government of the Ottoman Empire]].

This eclectic administration was apparent even in the diplomatic correspondence of the Empire, which was initially undertaken in the [[Greek language]] to the west.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Naim Kapucu|author2=Hamit Palabiyik|title=Turkish Public Administration: From Tradition to the Modern Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWceNjwTggUC&pg=PA78|accessdate=12 February 2013|year=2008|publisher=USAK Books|isbn=978-605-4030-01-9|page=78}}</ref>

The [[Tughra]] were calligraphic monograms, or signatures, of the Ottoman Sultans, of which there were 35. Carved on the Sultan's seal, they bore the names of the Sultan and his father. The statement and prayer, "ever victorious," was also present in most. The earliest belonged to [[Orhan|Orhan Gazi]]. The ornately stylized ''Tughra'' spawned a branch of Ottoman-Turkish [[calligraphy]].

=== Law ===
{{Main|Ottoman law}}
The Ottoman legal system accepted the [[religious law]] over its subjects. At the same time the ''[[Qanun (law)|Qanun]]'' (or ''Kanun''), a secular legal system, co-existed with religious law or [[Sharia]].<ref name=otmkanun>{{cite web|title=Balancing Sharia: The Ottoman Kanun|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/24365067|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 October 2013}}</ref> The Ottoman Empire was always organized around a system of local [[jurisprudence]].

The entire system was regulated from above by means of the administrative ''Qanun'', i.e. laws, a system based upon the Turkic ''[[Yassa]]'' and ''[[Töre (law)|Töre]]'', which were developed in the pre-Islamic era.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|An Ottoman trial, 1877]]

These court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive: for instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Hadīth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijmā']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs. Both systems were taught at the Empire's law schools, which were in [[Istanbul]] and [[Bursa]].

[[File:Zibik.jpg|thumb|An unhappy wife complains to the [[Qadi]] about her husband's impotence, [[Ottoman miniature]].]]

The Ottoman Islamic legal system was set up differently from traditional European courts. Presiding over Islamic courts would be a ''Qadi'', or judge. Since the closing of the ''[[ijtihad]]'', or ''Gate of Interpretation, Qadis ''throughout the Ottoman Empire focused less on legal precedent, and more with local customs and traditions in the areas that they administered.<ref name="Benton 109-110"/> However, the Ottoman court system lacked an appellate structure, leading to jurisdictional case strategies where plaintiffs could take their disputes from one court system to another until they achieved a ruling that was in their favor.

In the late 19th century, the Ottoman legal system saw substantial reform. This process of legal modernization began with the [[Edict of Gülhane]] of 1839.<ref name="review-niza">{{cite web|title=Review of "Ottoman Nizamiye Courts.

These reforms were based heavily on French models, as indicated by the adoption of a three-tiered court system. Referred to as [[Nizamiye]], this system was extended to the local magistrate level with the final promulgation of the [[Mecelle]], a civil code that regulated marriage, divorce, alimony, will, and other matters of personal status.<ref name="int-handbook"/> In an attempt to clarify the division of judicial competences, an administrative council laid down that religious matters were to be handled by religious courts, and statute matters were to be handled by the Nizamiye courts.<ref name="int-handbook"/>

The first military unit of the Ottoman State was an army that was organized by [[Osman I]] from the tribesmen inhabiting the hills of western Anatolia in the late 13th century. The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included [[Janissary]], [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Akıncı]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehterân]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Siege of Constantinople]]. The Ottoman cavalry depended on high speed and mobility rather than heavy armour, using bows and short swords on fast [[Turkoman horse|Turkoman]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] horses (progenitors of the [[Thoroughbred#Foundation stallions|Thoroughbred]] racing horse),<ref>{{cite book|last=Milner|first=Mordaunt|title=The Godolphin Arabian: The Story of the Matchem Line|year=1990|publisher=Robert Hale Limited|isbn=978-0-85131-476-1|pages=3–6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wall|first=John F|title=Famous Running Horses: Their Forebears and Descendants|isbn=978-1-163-19167-5|page=8}}</ref> and often applied tactics similar to those of the [[Mongol Empire]], such as pretending to retreat while surrounding the enemy forces inside a crescent-shaped formation and then making the real attack.

The modernization of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century started with the military. In 1826 Sultan [[Mahmud II]] abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-ı Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the [[Young Turks]] movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.

The [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and [[Egypt]] to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (reigned 1861–1876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France. The shipyard at Barrow, England, built its first [[submarine]] in 1886 for the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="first submarine at shipyard">{{cite web|url=http://www.ellesmereportstandard.co.uk/latest-north-west-news/Petition-created-for-submarine-name.4001190.jp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423225019/http://www.ellesmereportstandard.co.uk/latest-north-west-news/Petition-created-for-submarine-name.4001190.jp |archivedate=23 April 2008 |title=Petition created for submarine name |publisher=Ellesmere Port Standard |accessdate=11 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

However, the collapsing Ottoman economy could not sustain the fleet's strength for too long. Sultan [[Abdülhamid II]] distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist [[Midhat Pasha]], and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]]. He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years. Following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] sought to develop a strong Ottoman naval force. The ''Ottoman Navy Foundation'' was established in 1910 to buy new ships through public donations.

The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous.<ref name="Inalcik1970217">{{cite book |last=İnalcık |first=Halil |authorlink=Halil İnalcık |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=M.

Modern Ottoman studies indicate that the change in relations between the Ottoman Turks and central Europe was caused by the opening of the new sea routes. It is possible to see the decline in the significance of the land routes to the East as Western Europe opened the ocean routes that bypassed the Middle East and Mediterranean as parallel to the decline of the Ottoman Empire itself.<ref>Donald Quataert, ''The Ottoman Empire 1700–1922" (2005) p 24</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2016}} The [[Anglo-Ottoman Treaty]], also known as the [[Treaty of Balta Liman]] that opened the Ottoman markets directly to English and French competitors, would be seen as one of the staging posts along this development.

By developing commercial centres and routes, encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions, the state performed basic economic functions in the Empire. But in all this the financial and political interests of the state were dominant. Within the social and political system they were living in, Ottoman administrators could not have seen the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in Western Europe.<ref name="Inalcik1970218">{{cite book |last=İnalcık |first=Halil |authorlink=Halil İnalcık |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=M.

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] argues that [[free trade]] contributed to [[deindustrialization]] in the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to the [[protectionism]] of [[China]], Japan, and [[Spain]], the Ottoman Empire had a [[Economic liberalism|liberal trade]] policy, open to foreign imports. This has origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673 and 1740, which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but later criticized by British politicians such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32}}</ref>

Censuses of Ottoman territories only began in the early 19th century. Figures from 1831 onwards are available as official census results, but the censuses did not cover the whole population.

However, it began to rise to reach 25–32 million by 1800, with around 10 million in the European provinces (primarily the [[Balkans]]), 11 million in the Asiatic provinces and around 3 million in the African provinces.

Towards the end of the empire's existence [[life expectancy]] was 49 years, compared to the mid-twenties in Serbia at the beginning of the 19th century.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 112}} Epidemic diseases and [[famine]] caused major disruption and demographic changes. In 1785 around one sixth of the Egyptian population died from plague and Aleppo saw its population reduced by twenty percent in the 18th century. Six famines hit Egypt alone between 1687 and 1731 and the last famine to hit Anatolia was four decades later.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 113}}

The rise of port cities saw the clustering of populations caused by the development of steamships and railroads. Urbanization increased from 1700 to 1922, with towns and cities growing. Improvements in health and sanitation made them more attractive to live and work in. Port cities like Salonica, in Greece, saw its population rise from 55,000 in 1800 to 160,000 in 1912 and İzmir which had a population of 150,000 in 1800 grew to 300,000 by 1914.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 114}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pamuk|first=S|title=The Ottoman Empire and the World Economy: The Nineteenth Century|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|date=August 1991|volume=23|issue=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> Some regions conversely had population falls – Belgrade saw its population drop from 25,000 to 8,000 mainly due to political strife.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 114}}

Economic and political migrations made an impact across the empire. For example, the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and Austria-Habsburg annexation of the Crimean and Balkan regions respectively saw large influxes of Muslim refugees – 200,000 Crimean Tartars fleeing to Dobruja.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 115}} Between 1783 and 1913, approximately 5–7 million refugees flooded into the Ottoman Empire, at least 3.8 million of whom were from Russia. Some migrations left indelible marks such as political tension between parts of the empire (e.g. Turkey and Bulgaria) whereas centrifugal effects were noticed in other territories, simpler demographics emerging from diverse populations. Economies were also impacted with the loss of artisans, merchants, manufacturers and agriculturists.{{sfn|Quataert|2000|p = 116}} Since the 19th century, a large proportion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans emigrated to present-day Turkey.

Because of a low literacy rate among the public (about 2–3% until the early 19th century and just about 15% at the end of the 19th century), ordinary people had to hire [[scribes]] as "special request-writers" (''arzuhâlci''s) to be able to communicate with the government.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kemal H.

Turkic peoples practiced a variety of [[shamanism]] before adopting Islam. [[Abbasid]] influence in Central Asia was ensured through a process that was greatly facilitated by the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]]. Many of the various Turkic tribes—including the [[Oghuz Turks]], who were the ancestors of both the Seljuks and the Ottomans—gradually converted to Islam, and brought the religion with them to Anatolia beginning in the 11th century.

With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic [[caliphate]], although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with [[Murad I]] (reigned 1362 to 1389).<ref name="Lambton"/> The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] and the exile of the last caliph, [[Abdülmecid II]], to France.

In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the Muslim ''[[dhimmi]]'' system, Christians were guaranteed limited freedoms (such as the right to worship). They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride on horseback, their houses could not overlook those of Muslims, in addition to various other legal limitations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Akçam|first=Taner|title=A shameful act: the Armenian genocide and the question of Turkish responsibility|year=2006|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7932-7|page=24|authorlink=Taner Akçam}}</ref> Many Christians and Jews converted in order to secure full status in the society.

Under the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system, non-Muslim people were considered subjects of the Empire, but were not subject to the Muslim faith or Muslim law. The Orthodox millet, for instance, was still officially legally subject to [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]], which had been in effect in the Byzantine Empire for 900 years. Also, as the largest group of non-Muslim subjects (or ''[[Dhimmi|zimmi]]'') of the Islamic Ottoman state, the Orthodox millet was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce, and had to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Krummerich.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610014150/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Krummerich.htm |archivedate=10 June 2009 |title=The Divinely-Protected, Well-Flourishing Domain: The Establishment of the Ottoman System in the Balkan Peninsula |first=Sean |last=Krummerich |journal=The Student Historical Journal |volume=30 |year=1998–99 |publisher=Loyola University New Orleans |accessdate=11 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaled.org/nyworld/materials/ottoman/turkish.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010320091629/http://globaled.org/nyworld/materials/ottoman/turkish.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 March 2001 |title=Turkish Toleration |publisher=The American Forum for Global Education |accessdate=11 February 2013 }}</ref>

Similar millets were established for the Ottoman Jewish community, who were under the authority of the ''[[Hakham Bashi|Haham Başı]]'' or Ottoman [[Chief rabbi]]; the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] community, who were under the authority of a head bishop; and a number of other religious communities as well.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=A Concise History of Islam|last=Syed|first=Muzaffar Husain|publisher=Vij Books India|year=2011|isbn=978-9381411094|location=New Delhi, India|pages=97}}</ref> Some argue that the millet system is an example of pre-modern [[religious pluralism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sachedina |first=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein |date=2001 |title=The Islamic Roots of Democratic Pluralism |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=96–97 |isbn=0-19-513991-7 |quote=The millet system in the Muslim world provided the pre-modern paradigm of a religiously pluralistic society by granting each religious community an official status and a substantial measure of self-government.}}</ref>

=== Social-political-religious structure===
Society, government and religion was inter-related in complex ways after about 1800, in a complex overlapping, inefficient system that Atatürk systematically dismantled after 1922.<ref>Philip D. Curtin, ''The World and the West: The European Challenge and the Overseas Response in the Age of Empire'' (2002), pp 173-92.</ref><ref>Fatma Muge Gocek, ''Rise of the Bourgeoisie, Demise of Empire: Ottoman Westernization and Social Change'' (1996) pp 138-42</ref>  In Constantinople, the Sultan  ruled two distinct domains the secular government and the religious hierarchy. Religious officials formed the [[Ulama]] Who had control of religious teachings and theology, and also the Empire's judicial system, Giving them a major voice in day-to-day affairs in communities across the Empire (but not including the non-Moslem millets). They were powerful enough to reject the military reforms proposed by Sultan [[Selim III]]. His successor Sultan [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808–1839) first won ulama approval before proposing similar reforms.<ref>Kemal H. Karpat, "The transformation of the Ottoman State, 1789-1908." ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 3#3 (1972): 243-281. [http://psi424.cankaya.edu.tr/uploads/files/Karpat,%20Transformation%20of%20the%20Ott%20State,%201789-1908%20(1972).pdf online]</ref>  The secularization program of Atatürk brought ended the ulema and their institutions. The caliphate was abolished, madrasas were closed down and the sharia courts abolished.  He replaced the Arabic alphabet with Latin letters, ended the religious school system, and gave women some political rights.  Many rural traditionalists never accepted this secularization, and by the 1990s they were reasserting a demand for a larger role for Islam.<ref>{{cite book|author=Amit Bein|title=Ottoman Ulema, Turkish Republic: Agents of Change and Guardians of Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1xfDfgPJr8C&pg=PA141|year=2011|publisher=Stanford UP|page=141}}</ref>

The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826. They were very powerful military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan [[Mahmud II]] crushed the revolt, executed the leaders, and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into a Turkish language that used Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  The large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their own separate segregated domains called "[[milletts]]".<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, "The Ottoman millet system: Non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy." ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24-42.</ref> They were primarily Greek, Armenian or Jewish.  In each locality they governed themselves, spoke their own language, ran their own schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millett. The Imperial government protected them, and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881–1908'' (1083) </ref> In addition, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and develop their own separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan but those near Mecca bought the British promise.<ref>Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp 56-100.</ref>

At the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|"ayan"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gábor Ágoston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64}}</ref>

The economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, Were allowed their own presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians. 

After the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was clearly shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805 and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive is the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia.  Europeans all thought it was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, in their support led to the Empire joining the central powers in 1915, and coming out one of the heaviest losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>

The Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered, and added new dimensions to them. Numerous traditions and cultural traits of previous empires (in fields such as architecture, cuisine, music, leisure and government) were adopted by the Ottoman Turks, who elaborated them into new forms, resulting in a new and distinctively Ottoman cultural identity. Despite newer added amalgamations, the Ottoman dynasty, like their predecessors in the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Seljuk Empire]], were thoroughly Persianised in their culture, language, habits and customs, and therefore the empire has been described as a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] empire.<ref name="iranica">{{cite encyclopedia|first=O. |last=Özgündenli |title=Persian Manuscripts in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Libraries |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica |edition=online |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122005207/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{citation|chapter = Persian in service of the state: the role of Persophone historical writing in the development of an Ottoman imperial aesthetic|title = Studies on Persianate Societies|volume = 2|date = 2004|pages = 145–63}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title = Historiography. xi.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Ottoman literature}}

The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and [[prose]]. Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analogue genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].

Ottoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير mura'ât-i nazîr / تناسب tenâsüb) and opposition (تضاد tezâd) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kasîdes. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mesnevî, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuzûlî]] and the [[Hüsn ü Aşk]] of [[Şeyh Gâlib]].

[[File:Nedim (divan edb.şairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Nedîm Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]

Until the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (سجع, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanlı'da kurumlar ve kültür |year=2005 |publisher=İstanbul Bilgi Üniversitesi Yayınları |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was [[Muhayyelât]] ("Fancies") by [[Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi]], a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was by an Armenian named [[Vartan Pasha]]. Published in 1851, the novel was entitled The Story of Akabi (Turkish: Akabi Hikyayesi) and was written in Turkish but with [[Armenian language|Armenian]] script.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mignon|first1=Laurent|title=Neither Shiraz nor Paris : papers on modern Turkish literature|date=2005|publisher=ISIS|location=Istanbul|isbn=9754283036|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AbQZAQAAIAAJ|quote=Those words could have been readily adopted by Hovsep Vartanyan (1813– 1879), the author, who preferred to remain anonymous, of The Story of Akabi (Akabi Hikyayesi), the first novel in Turkish, published with Armenian characters in the same year as [[Hovhannes Hisarian|Hisarian]]'s novel.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Masters|first1=Bruce|last2=Ágoston|first2=Gábor|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|date=2009|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York, NY|isbn=1438110251|page=440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|quote=Written in Turkish using the Armenian alphabet, the Akabi History (1851) by Vartan Pasha is considered by some to be the first Ottoman novel.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pultar|first1=Gönül|title=Imagined identities : identity formation in the age of globalism|date=2013|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0815633424|page=329|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhiQAwAAQBAJ|quote=In fact, one of the first Turkish works of fiction in Western-type novel form, Akabi Hikayesi (Akabi's Story), was written in Turkish by Vartan Pasha (born Osep/Hovsep Vartanian/Vartanyan, 1813– 1879) and published in Armenian characters in 1851.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gürçaglar |first1=Şehnaz |last2=Paker |first2=Saliha |last3=Milton |first3=John |date=2015 |title=Tradition, Tension and Translation in Turkey |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |page=5 |isbn=90-272-6847-9 |quote=It is interesting that the first Ottoman novel in Turkish, Akabi Hikayesi (1851, Akabi's Story), was written and published in Armenian letters (for Armenian communities who read in Turkish) by Hovsep Vartanyan (1813–1879), known as Vartan Paşa, a leading Ottoman man of letters and journalist.}}</ref>

Due to historically close ties with France, [[French literature]] came to constitute the major Western influence on Ottoman literature throughout the latter half of the 19th century. As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents: in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.

Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namık Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel İntibâh ("Awakening"), while the journalist [[İbrahim Şinasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy "Şair Evlenmesi" ("The Poet's Marriage"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled "Vakâyi'-i 'Acibe ve Havâdis-i Garibe-yi Kefşger Ahmed" ("The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century, but there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mellâh yâhud Sırr İçinde Esrâr, 1873; "Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery"), Realism (Henüz On Yedi Yaşında, 1881; "Just Seventeen Years Old"), and Naturalism (Müşâhedât, 1891; "Observations"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=Türk Romanına Eleştirel Bir Bakış Vol. 1|isbn=975-470-054-0|page=19}}</ref>

[[File:Dolmabahçe Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]

[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] the early or first Ottoman architecture period, Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire become the classical period of architecture, when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.

[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]

During the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]] and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s and tombs.

Examples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul and [[Edirne]], can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>

=== Decorative arts ===
[[File:Ottoman_miniature_painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]

The tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form, though it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.

[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the figurative images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.

The art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism, and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name="foroqhi">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=1-85043-760-2|page=152|edition=New}}</ref> The weaving of such carpets originated in the [[nomad]]ic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia. Turks used carpets, rugs and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room, but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name="foroqhip153">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

=== Music and performing arts ===
[[Ottoman classical music]] was an important part of the education of the Ottoman elite. A number of the Ottoman sultans were accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organised around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.

The [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|bağlama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and—later in the tradition—Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music, and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are: Balkan-Thracian Türküs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) Türküs, Aegean Türküs, Central Anatolian Türküs, Eastern Anatolian Türküs, and Caucasian Türküs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].

[[Ottoman cuisine]] refers to the cuisine of the capital, [[Istanbul]], and the regional capital cities, where the melting pot of cultures created a common cuisine that most of the population regardless of ethnicity shared. This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yalı]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.

Much of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name="Fragner">Bert Fragner, "From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[döner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cacık]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[köfte]]/keftés/kofta, [[börek]]/boureki, [[rakı]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[keşkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.

Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name="Ágoston and Alan Masters583"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century. [[Mehmet II|Sultan Mehmet II]] ordered [[Georgios Amiroutzes]], a Greek scholar from [[Trabzon]], to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of [[Ptolemy]]. Another example is [[Ali Qushji]] – an [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] and [[Islamic physics|physicist]] originally from [[Samarkand]] – who became a professor in two madrasas and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years in Istanbul before his death.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ragep |first1=F.

[[File:Istambul observatory in 1577.jpg|thumb|[[Istanbul observatory of Taqi ad-Din]] in 1577]]

[[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] built the [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din]] in 1577, where he carried out observations until 1580. He calculated the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the Sun's orbit and the annual motion of the [[apogee]].<ref name="Tekeli">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Sevim Tekeli |title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology and medicine in non-western cultures|entry=Taqi al-Din|year=1997 |publisher=Kluwer |isbn=0-7923-4066-3|bibcode=2008ehst.book.....S|journal=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science}}</ref> However, the observatory's primary purpose was almost certainly [[astrology|astrological]] rather than astronomical, leading to its destruction in 1580 due to the rise of a clerical faction that opposed its use for that purpose.<ref>{{cite book |last=El-Rouayheb |first=Khaled |title=Islamic Intellectual History in the Seventeenth Century: Scholarly Currents in the Ottoman Empire and the Maghreb |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-04296-4 |pages=18–9}}</ref> He also experimented with [[steam power]] in [[Ottoman Egypt]] in 1551, when he invented a [[steam jack]] driven by a rudimentary [[steam turbine]].<ref>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]] (1976), ''Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering'', p. 34–35, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, [[University of Aleppo]]</ref>

In 1660 the Ottoman scholar [[Ibrahim Efendi al-Zigetvari Tezkireci]] translated [[Noël Duret]]'s French astronomical work (written in 1637) into Arabic.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ben-Zaken |first=Avner |year=2004 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1607448/The_heavens_of_the_sky_and_the_heavens_of_the_heart_the_Ottoman_cultural_context_for_the_introduction_of_post-Copernican_astronomy_I_would_like_to_thank_Theodore_Porter_Hossein_Ziai_Carlo_Ginzburg_Robert_Westman_Mary_Terrall_Benjamin_Elman_Norton_Wise_Herbert_Davidson_and_Ahmad_Alwisha_for_the_notes_and_the_encouragement._Thanks_to_Howard_Goodman_for_the_notes_and_the_stylish_English._Special_thanks_to_the_anonymous_referees_for_the_illuminating_notes._The_paper_was_first_presented_at_the_History_of_Science_Colloquium_at_UCLA |title=The Heavens of the Sky and the Heavens of the Heart: the Ottoman Cultural Context for the Introduction of Post-Copernican Astronomy |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |volume=37 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1017/S0007087403005302 |ref=harv}}</ref>

[[Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu]] was the author of the first surgical atlas and the last major [[Medicine in medieval Islam|medical encyclopedia from the Islamic world]]. Though his work was largely based on [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]]'s ''[[Al-Tasrif]]'', Sabuncuoğlu introduced many innovations of his own. Female surgeons were also illustrated for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bademci |first=G. |title=First illustrations of female Neurosurgeons in the fifteenth century by Serefeddin Sabuncuoglu |journal=Neurocirugía |year=2006 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=162–5 |doi=10.4321/S1130-14732006000200012}}</ref>

An example of a watch that measured time in minutes was created by an Ottoman watchmaker, [[Meshur Sheyh Dede]], in 1702.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Horton |first=Paul |title=Topkapi's Turkish Timepieces |date=July–August 1977 |journal=[[Saudi Aramco World]] |pages=10–13 |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197704/topkapi.s.turkish.timepieces.htm |accessdate=12 July 2008 |ref=harv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122021637/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197704/topkapi.s.turkish.timepieces.htm |archive-date=22 November 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the early 19th century, [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] began using [[steam engine]]s for industrial manufacturing, with industries such as [[ironworks]], [[textile manufacturing]], [[paper mill]]s and [[hulling]] mills moving towards steam power.<ref name="batou193">{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC&pg=PA193|pages=193–196|isbn=9782600042932}}</ref> Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions existed in Egypt for the adoption of [[oil]] as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.<ref name="batou193"/>

In the 19th century, [[Ishak Efendi]] is credited with introducing the then current Western scientific ideas and developments to the Ottoman and wider Muslim world, as well as the invention of a suitable Turkish and Arabic scientific terminology, through his translations of Western works.

== Sports ==
[[File:Oil wrestling match in the gardens of the Sultan's Palace.jpg|thumb|right|Ottoman wrestlers in the gardens of [[Topkapı Palace]], in the 19th century]]

The main sports Ottomans were engaged in were [[Turkish wrestling]], [[hunting]], [[Turkish archery]], [[horseback riding]], [[Cirit|equestrian javelin throw]], [[arm wrestling]], and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. European model sports clubs were formed with the spreading popularity of [[football]] matches in 19th century [[Constantinople]]. The leading clubs, according to timeline, were [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş Gymnastics Club]] (1903), [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray Sports Club]] (1905), [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe Sports Club]] (1907), [[MKE Ankaragücü |MKE Ankaragücü (formerly Turan Sanatkaragücü)]] (1910) in [[Istanbul]]. Football clubs were formed in other provinces too, such as [[Karşıyaka S.K.|Karşıyaka Sports Club]] (1912), [[Altay S.K.|Altay Sports Club]] (1914) and [[Ülküspor|Turkish Fatherland Football Club]] (later [[Ülküspor]]) (1914) of [[İzmir]].

The '''Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78''' ({{lang-tr|93 Harbi|lit=War of ’93}}, named for the year 1293 in the [[Islamic calendar]]; {{lang-bg|Руско-турска Освободителна война|Rusko-turska Osvoboditelna vojna}}, "Russian-Turkish Liberation war") was a conflict between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] coalition led by the [[Russian Empire]] and composed of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Crowe, John Henry Verrinder |author-link =  |chapter=Russo-Turkish Wars (1828-29 and 1877-1878 - The War of 1877-78) |title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica; A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |pages= 931-936 |year=1911 |volume= XXIII (REFECTORY to SAINTE-BEUVE)|edition= 11th |publisher=At the University Press |place=Cambridge, England and New York|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri23chisrich#page/930 |accessdate= 19 July 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}</ref> Fought in the [[Balkans]] and in the [[Caucasus]], it originated in emerging [[19th-century]] Balkan [[nationalism]]. Additional factors combined Russian goals of recovering territorial losses endured during the [[Crimean War]], re-establishing itself in the [[Black Sea]] and supporting the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire.

The Russian-led coalition won the war. As a result, Russia succeeded in claiming several provinces in the Caucasus, namely [[Kars Oblast|Kars]] and [[Batum Oblast|Batum]], and also annexed the [[Budjak]] region. The principalities of [[United Principalities|Romania]], [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], each of whom had ''de facto'' sovereignty for some time, formally proclaimed independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After almost five centuries of Ottoman domination (1396–1878), the Bulgarian state was re-established as the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], covering the land between the [[Danube]] River and the [[Balkan Mountains]] (except Northern [[Dobrudja]] which was given to Romania), as well as the region of [[Sofia]], which became the new state's capital. The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 also allowed [[Austria-Hungary]] to [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Great Britain]] to take over [[Cyprus]].

The initial Treaty of San Stefano, signed on 3 March, is today celebrated as [[Liberation Day]] in Bulgaria,<ref>{{cite book|title=Labour Law in Bulgaria|first=Vasil|last=Mrŭchkov|p=120|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2011|isbn=978-9-041-13616-9}}</ref> although it somewhat fell out of favour during years of Socialist rule.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nationalism from the Left: The Bulgarian Communist Party During the Second World War and the Early Post-War Years|first=Yannis|last=Sygkelos|p=220|publisher=Brill|year=2011|isbn=978-9-004-19208-9}}</ref>

==Conflict pre-history==
=== Treatment of Christians in the Ottoman Empire ===
Article 9 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|1856 Paris Peace Treaty]], concluded at the end of the [[Crimean War]], obliged the Ottoman Empire to grant Christians equal rights with Muslims. Before the treaty was signed, the Ottoman government issued an edict, the [[Edict of Gülhane]], which proclaimed the principle of the equality of Muslims and non-Muslims,<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/reform.htm | type = full text | title = Hatt-ı Hümayun | publisher = Anayasa | place = Turkey}}.</ref> and produced some specific reforms to this end. For example, the [[jizya]] tax was abolished and non-Muslims were allowed to join the army.<ref>{{Citation | last = Vatikiotis | first = PJ | title = The Middle East | place = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1997 | page = 217 | ISBN = 0-415-15849-4}}.</ref>

However, some key aspects of [[dhimmi]] status were retained, including that the testimony of Christians against Muslims was not accepted in courts, which granted Muslims effective immunity for offenses conducted against Christians. Although local level relations between communities were often good, this practice encouraged exploitation. Abuses were at their worst in regions with a predominantly Christian population, where local authorities often openly supported abuse as a means to keep Christians subjugated.{{Sfn | Argyll | 1879}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2013}}

====Crisis in Lebanon, 1860====
{{Main|1860 Druze–Maronite conflict}}
In 1858, the [[Maronite]] peasants, stirred by the clergy, revolted against their [[Druze]] feudal overlords and established a peasant republic. In southern [[Lebanon]], where Maronite peasants worked for Druze overlords, Druze peasants sided with their overlords against the Maronites, transforming the conflict into a [[1860 Druze-Christian conflict in Lebanon|civil war]]. Although both sides suffered, about 10,000 Maronites were [[massacre]]d at the hands of the Druze.<ref name="countrystudies.us">{{Citation | url = http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/74.htm | title = Country Studies | contribution = Lebanon | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | year = 1994}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=cdl;idno=cdl324 | page = 219 | title = The Druzes and the Maronites under the Turkish rule from 1840 to 1860 | first = C | last = Churchill | place = London | publisher = B Quaritch | year = 1862}}.</ref>

Under the threat of European intervention, Ottoman authorities restored order. Nevertheless, [[Règlement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French and British intervention]] followed.{{Sfn | Shaw | Shaw | 1977 | pp = 142–43}} Under further European pressure, the Sultan agreed to appoint a Christian governor in Lebanon, whose candidacy was to be submitted by the Sultan and approved by the European powers.<ref name = "countrystudies.us" />

On May 27, 1860 a group of Maronites raided a Druze village.{{Citation needed|date =March 2008}} Massacres and reprisal massacres followed, not only in the Lebanon but also in [[Syria]]. In the end, between 7,000 and 12,000 people of all religions{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} had been killed, and over 300 villages, 500 churches, 40 monasteries, and 30 schools were destroyed. Christian attacks on Muslims in Beirut stirred the Muslim population of [[Damascus]] to attack the Christian minority with between 5,000 and 25,000 of the latter being killed,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} including the [[United States of America|American]] and [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] consuls, giving the event an international dimension.

Ottoman foreign minister [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha]] came to Syria and solved the problems by seeking out and executing the culprits, including the governor and other officials. Order was restored, and preparations made to give Lebanon new autonomy to avoid European intervention. Nevertheless, in September 1860 France sent a fleet, and Britain joined to prevent a unilateral intervention that could help increase French influence in the area at Britain's expense.{{Sfn | Shaw | Shaw | 1977 | pp = 142–43}}

====The revolt in Crete, 1866–1869====
[[File:MoniArkadiou2.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Moni Arkadiou]] monastery]]
The [[Cretan Revolt (1866–69)|Cretan Revolt]], which began in 1866, resulted from the failure of the Ottoman Empire to apply reforms for improving the life of the population and the Cretans' desire for [[enosis]] — union with [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robson|first1=Maureen M.|title=Lord Clarendon and the Cretan Question, 1868-9|journal=The Historical Journal|date=1960|volume=3|issue=1|pages=38–55}}</ref> The insurgents gained control over the whole island, except for five cities where the Muslims were fortified. The Greek press claimed that Muslims had massacred Greeks and the word was spread throughout Europe. Thousands of Greek volunteers were mobilized and sent to the island.

The siege of [[Moni Arkadiou]] monastery became particularly well known. In November 1866, about 250 Cretan Greek combatants and around 600 women and children were besieged by about 23,000 mainly Cretan Muslims aided by Ottoman troops, and this became widely known in Europe. After a bloody battle with a large number of casualties on both sides, the Cretan Greeks finally surrendered when their ammunition ran out but were killed upon surrender.<ref>{{Citation | last = Stillman | first = William James | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11594/11594.txt | title = The Autobiography of a Journalist | volume = II | publisher = The Project Gutenberg | format = ebook | date = March 15, 2004 | id = [[eBook#11594]]}}.</ref>

By early 1869, the insurrection was suppressed, but [[Ottoman Porte|the Porte]] offered some concessions, introducing island self-rule and increasing Christian rights on the island. Although the Cretan crisis ended better for the Ottomans than almost any other diplomatic confrontation of the century, the insurrection, and especially the brutality with which it was suppressed, led to greater public attention in Europe to the oppression of Christians in the Ottoman Empire.

{{Quote |Small as the amount of attention is which can be given by the people of England to the affairs of Turkey ... enough was transpiring from time to time to produce a vague but a settled and general impression that the Sultans were not fulfilling the "solemn promises" they had made to Europe; that the vices of the Turkish government were ineradicable; and that whenever another crisis might arise affecting the "independence" of the Ottoman Empire, it would be wholly impossible to afford to it again the support we had afforded in the [[Crimean war]].{{Sfn | Argyll | 1879 | p = 122}}}}

===Changing balance of power in Europe===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
Although on the winning side in the [[Crimean War]], the Ottoman Empire [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|continued to decline]] in power and prestige. The financial strain on the treasury forced the Ottoman government to take a series of foreign loans at such steep interest rates that, despite all the fiscal reforms that followed, pushed it into unpayable debts and economic difficulties. This was further aggravated by the need to accommodate more than 600,000 Muslim [[Circassians]], expelled by the Russians from the Caucasus, to the Black Sea ports of north Anatolia and the Balkan ports of [[Constanţa]] and [[Varna]], which cost a great deal in money and in civil disorder to the Ottoman authorities.<ref>{{Citation | last = Finkel | first = Caroline | title = The History of the Ottoman Empire | place = New York | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2005 | page = 467}}.</ref>

====The New European Concert====
The [[Concert of Europe]] established in 1814 was shaken in 1859 when France and Austria [[Second Italian War of Independence|fought over Italy]]. It came apart completely as a result of the wars of [[German Unification]], when the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], led by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], defeated Austria in 1866 and France in 1870, replacing Austria-Hungary as the dominant power in Central Europe. Britain, worn out by its participation in the Crimean War and diverted by the [[Irish question]] and the social problems created by the [[Industrial Revolution]], chose not to intervene again to restore the European balance. Bismarck did not wish the breakup of the Ottoman Empire to create rivalries that might lead to war, so he took up the Tsar's earlier suggestion that arrangements be made in case the Ottoman Empire fell apart, creating the [[Three Emperors' League]] with Austria and Russia to keep France isolated on the continent.

France responded by supporting self-determination movements, particularly if they concerned the three emperors and the Sultan. Thus revolts in Poland against Russia and national aspirations in the Balkans were encouraged by France. Russia worked to regain its right to maintain a fleet on the Black Sea and vied with the French in gaining influence in the Balkans by using the new [[Pan-Slavic]] idea that all Slavs should be united under Russian leadership. This could be done only by destroying the two empires where most non-Russian Slavs lived, the Habsburg and the Ottoman Empires. The ambitions and the rivalries of the Russians and French in the Balkans surfaced in Serbia, which was experiencing its own national revival and had ambitions that partly conflicted with those of the great powers.{{Sfn | Shaw | Shaw | 1977 | p = 146}}

====Russia after the Crimean War====
[[File:Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Gorchakov]]]]

Russia ended the Crimean War with minimal territorial losses, but was forced to destroy its [[Black Sea Fleet]] and [[Sevastopol]] fortifications. Russian international prestige was damaged, and for many years revenge for the Crimean War became the main goal of Russian foreign policy. This was not easy though — the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Treaty]] included guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria; only Prussia remained friendly to Russia.

The newly appointed Russian chancellor, [[Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov|Alexander Gorchakov]] depended upon alliance with Prussia and its chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. Russia consistently supported Prussia in her wars with [[Second Schleswig War|Denmark (1864)]], [[Austro-Prussian War|Austria (1866)]] and [[Franco-Prussian War|France (1870)]]. In March 1871, using the crushing French defeat and the support of a grateful Germany, Russia achieved [[Commissions of the Danube River#London Conference of 1871|international recognition]] of its earlier denouncement of Article 11 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris Peace Treaty]], thus enabling it to revive the [[Black Sea Fleet]].

Other clauses of the Paris Peace Treaty, however, remained in force, specifically Article 8 with guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria. Therefore, Russia was extremely cautious in its relations with the Ottoman Empire, coordinating all its actions with other European powers. A Russian war with Turkey would require at least the tacit support of all other Great Powers, and Russian diplomacy was waiting for a convenient moment.

==Balkan crisis of 1875–1876==
The state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850.

Austria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of Serbia and Montenegro also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and [[irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents. At the same time, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the Empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare bankruptcy in October, 1875 and increase taxes on outlying provinces including the Balkans.

===Balkan uprisings===

====Herzegovina Uprising====
{{Main|Herzegovina Uprising (1875–78)}}
An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. By August almost all of Herzegovina had been seized and the revolt had spread into Bosnia. Supported by nationalist volunteers from Serbia and Montenegro, the uprising continued as the Ottomans committed more and more troops to suppress it.

====Bulgarian Uprising====
{{Main|April Uprising}}
[[File:Basibozuk-1877.jpg|thumb|Bashi-bazouks' atrocities in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]]]
The revolt of Bosnia and Herzegovina spurred Bucharest-based Bulgarian revolutionaries into action. In 1875, a Bulgarian uprising was hastily prepared to take advantage of Ottoman preoccupation, but it fizzled before it started. In the spring of 1876, another uprising erupted in the south-central Bulgarian lands despite the fact that there were numerous regular Turkish troops in those areas.

A special Turkish military committee was established to quell the uprising. Regular troops (Nisam) and irregular ones (Redif or Bashi-bazouk) were directed to fight the Bulgarians (May 11 – June 9, 1876). The irregulars were mostly drawn from the Muslim inhabitants of the Bulgarian regions, many of whom were [[Circassians|Circassian]] Islamic population which migrated from the [[Caucasus]] or [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]]s who were expelled during the [[Crimean War]] and even Islamized Bulgarians. The Turkish army suppressed the revolt, massacring up to 30,000{{Sfn | Hupchick | 2002 | p = 264}}{{Sfn | Jonassohn | 1999 | pp = 209–10}} people in the process.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Turkish empire from 1288 to 1914 | first = Baron George Shaw-Lefevre | last = Eversley | year = 1924 | page = 319}}.</ref>{{Sfn | Jonassohn | 1999 | p = 210}} Five thousand out of the seven thousand villagers of Batak were put to death.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = (Editorial staff) | title = Massacre | journal = New Statesman | volume = 6 | issue = 139 | pages = 201–202 | date = 4 December 1915 | url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015073107511;view=1up;seq=216}} ; see p. 202.</ref> Both Batak and Perushtitsa, where the majority of the population was also massacred, participated in the rebellion.{{Sfn | Jonassohn | 1999 | pp = 209–10}} Many of the perpetrators of those massacres were later decorated by the Ottoman high command.{{Sfn | Jonassohn | 1999 | pp = 209–10}} Modern historians have estimated the number of killed Bulgarian population is between 30,000 and 100,000.

===International reaction to atrocities in Bulgaria===
Word of the bashi-bazouks' atrocities filtered to the outside world by way of American-run Robert College located in [[Constantinople]]. The majority of the students were Bulgarian, and many received news of the events from their families back home. Soon the Western diplomatic community in Constantinople was abuzz with rumours, which eventually found their way into newspapers in the West. While in Constantinople in 1879, Protestant missionary [[George Warren Wood]] reported Turkish authorities in [[Amasya|Amasia]] brutally persecuting Christian Armenian refugees from [[Soukoum Kaleh]]. He was able to coordinate with British diplomat [[Edward Malet]] to bring the matter to the attention of the [[Sublime Porte]], and then to the British foreign secretary [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil]] (the [[Marquess of Salisbury]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Parliamentary Papers, House of Commons and Command, Volume 80|date=1880|publisher=Great Britain.

MacGahan toured the stricken regions of the Bulgarian uprising, and his report, splashed across the ''Daily News'''s front pages, galvanized British public opinion against Disraeli's pro-Ottoman policy.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacGahan |first=Januarius A. |date=1876 |title=Turkish Atrocities in Bulgaria, Letters of the Special Commissioner of the 'Daily News,' J.A.

The strongest reaction came from Russia. Widespread sympathy for the Bulgarian cause led to a nationwide surge in patriotism on a scale comparable with the one during the [[French invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]]. From autumn 1875, the movement to support the Bulgarian uprising involved all classes of Russian society. This was accompanied by sharp public discussions about Russian goals in this conflict: [[Slavophile]]s, including [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], saw in the impending war the chance to unite all Orthodox nations under Russia's helm, thus fulfilling what they believed was the historic mission of Russia, while their opponents, [[westernizer]]s, inspired by [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], denied the importance of religion and believed that Russian goals should not be defense of Orthodoxy but liberation of Bulgaria.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.libfl.ru/win/nbc/books/bolgaria.html |first=ВМ |last=Хевролина |script-title=ru:Россия и Болгария: "Вопрос Славянский — Русский Вопрос" |publisher=Lib FL |place=[[Russia|RU]] |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028062618/http://www.libfl.ru/win/nbc/books/bolgaria.html |archivedate=October 28, 2007 }}.</ref>

===Serbo-Turkish War and diplomatic manoeuvering===
{{Main|Serbo-Turkish War (1876–78)|Constantinople Conference|Expulsion of the Albanians 1877–1878}}

[[File:Punch - The Dogs of War.png|Russia preparing to release the Balkan dogs of war, while Britain warns him to take care. ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon from June 17, 1876|thumb|right]]
On June 30, 1876, Serbia, followed by [[Montenegro]], declared war on the Ottoman Empire. In July and August, the ill-prepared and poorly equipped Serbian army helped by Russian volunteers failed to achieve offensive objectives but did manage to repulse the Ottoman offensive into Serbia. Meanwhile, Russia's [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander Gorchakov|Prince Gorchakov]] met [[Austria-Hungary]]'s [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and [[Julius Andrassy|Count Andrássy]] in the [[Zákupy|Reichstadt]] castle in [[Bohemia]]. No written agreement was made, but during the discussions, Russia agreed to support Austrian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and [[Austria-Hungary]], in exchange, agreed to support the return of Southern [[Bessarabia]]—lost by Russia during the [[Crimean War]]—and Russian annexation of the port of [[Batumi|Batum]] on the east coast of the [[Black Sea]]. Bulgaria was to become autonomous (independent, according to the Russian records).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.diphis.ru/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=100#3 | title = History of world diplomacy 15th century BC – 1940 AD | last = Potemkin | first = VP | place = [[Russia|RU]] | publisher = Diphis}}.</ref>

As the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued, Serbia suffered a string of setbacks and asked the European powers to mediate an end to the war. A joint ultimatum by the European powers forced the Porte to give Serbia a one-month truce and start peace negotiations. Turkish peace conditions however were refused by European powers as too harsh. In early October, after the truce expired, the Turkish army resumed its offensive and the Serbian position quickly became desperate. On October 31, Russia issued an ultimatum requiring the Ottoman Empire to stop the hostilities and sign a new truce with Serbia within 48 hours. This was supported by the partial mobilization of the Russian army (up to 20 divisions). The Sultan accepted the conditions of the ultimatum.

To resolve the crisis, on December 11, 1876, the [[Constantinople Conference]] of the Great Powers was opened in Constantinople (to which the Turks were not invited). A compromise solution was negotiated, granting autonomy to [[Bulgaria]], Bosnia and Herzegovina under the joint control of European powers. The Ottomans, however, refused to sacrifice their independence by allowing international representatives to oversee the institution of reforms and sought to discredit the conference by announcing on December 23, the day the conference was closed, that a [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|constitution]] was adopted that declared equal rights for religious minorities within the Empire. The Ottomans attempted to use this manoeuver to get their objections and amendments to the agreement heard. When they were rejected by the Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire announced its decision to disregard the results of the conference.

On January 15, 1877, Russia and Austria-Hungary signed a written agreement confirming the results of an earlier [[Reichstadt Agreement]] in July 1876. This assured Russia of the benevolent neutrality of Austria-Hungary in the impending war. These terms meant that in case of war Russia would do the fighting and Austria would derive most of the advantage. Russia therefore made a final effort for a peaceful settlement. After reaching an agreement with its main Balkan rival and with anti-Ottoman sympathies running high throughout Europe due to the Bulgarian atrocities and the rejection of the Constantinople agreements, Russia finally felt free to declare war.

===Opening manoeuvres===

Russia declared war on the Ottomans on 24 April 1877 and its troops entered Romania through the newly built [[Eiffel Bridge, Ungheni|Eiffel Bridge]] near Ungheni, on the Prut river. On April 12, 1877, Romania gave permission to the Russian troops to pass through its territory to attack the Turks, resulting in Turkish bombardments of Romanian towns on the Danube. On May 10, 1877, the [[Principality of Romania]], which was under formal Turkish rule, declared its independence.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/cronologieen.html | title = Chronology of events from 1856 to 1997 period relating to the Romanian monarchy | publisher = Kent State University | place = Ohio | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230042922/http://www.cs.kent.edu/~amarcus/Mihai/english/cronologieen.html | archivedate = 2007-12-30 | df =  }}</ref>

At the beginning of the war, the outcome was far from obvious. The Russians could send a larger army into the Balkans: about 300,000 troops were within reach. The Ottomans had about 200,000 troops on the Balkan peninsula, of which about 100,000 were assigned to fortified garrisons, leaving about 100,000 for the army of operation. The Ottomans had the advantage of being fortified, complete command of the Black Sea, and patrol boats along the [[Danube]] river.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://archive.org/details/warineastillustr00scheiala | title = The War in the East: An illustrated history of the Conflict between Russia and Turkey with a Review of the Eastern Question | year = 1878 | author-link = Alexander Jacob Schem | last = Schem | first = Alexander Jacob}}.</ref> They also possessed superior arms, including new British and American-made rifles and German-made artillery.

[[File:Pereprava cherez Dunaj.jpg|thumb|left|Russian crossing of the Danube, June 1877, painting by [[Nikolai Dmitriev-Orenburgsky]], 1883]]

In the event, however, the Ottomans usually resorted to passive defense, leaving the strategic initiative to the Russians, who, after making some mistakes, found a winning strategy for the war. The Ottoman military command in Constantinople made poor assumptions of Russian intentions. They decided that Russians would be too lazy to march along the Danube and cross it away from the delta, and would prefer the short way along the [[Black Sea]] coast. This would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest, best supplied and garrisoned Turkish fortresses. There was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the river Danube, [[Vidin]]. It was garrisoned only because the troops, led by Osman Pasha, had just taken part in defeating the Serbs in their recent war against the Ottoman Empire.

The Russian campaign was better planned, but it relied heavily on Turkish passivity. A crucial Russian mistake was sending too few troops initially; an expeditionary force of about 185,000 crossed the Danube in June, slightly less than the combined Turkish forces in the Balkans (about 200,000). After setbacks in July (at [[Pleven]] and [[Stara Zagora]]), the Russian military command realized it did not have the reserves to keep the offensive going and switched to a defensive posture. The Russians did not even have enough forces to blockade Pleven properly until late August, which effectively delayed the whole campaign for about two months.

===Balkan theatre===
[[File:Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).png|thumb|Map of the Balkan Theater]]
At the start of the war, Russia and Romania destroyed all vessels along the Danube and [[Naval mine|mined]] the river, thus ensuring that Russian forces could cross the Danube at any point without resistance from the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]]. The Ottoman command did not appreciate the significance of the Russians' actions. In June, a small Russian unit crossed the Danube close to the delta, at [[Galați]], and marched towards Ruschuk (today [[Rousse|Ruse]]). This made the Ottomans even more confident that the big Russian force would come right through the middle of the Ottoman stronghold.

[[File:Kärtchen zur Schlacht bei Plewna (11. & 12.09.1877).jpg|thumb|left|Russian, Romanian and Ottoman troop movements at [[Pleven|Plevna]]]]

On 25–26 May, a Romanian torpedo boat with a mixed Romanian-Russian crew [[Action off Măcin|attacked and sank]] an Ottoman monitor on the Danube.<ref>[http://www.navypedia.org/ships/turkey/tu_of_hizber.htm Navypedia.org: Ottoman navy: Hizber river monitors]</ref> Under the direct command of Major-General [[Mikhail Ivanovich Dragomirov]], on the night of 27/28 June 1877 ([[New Style|NS]]) the Russians constructed a pontoon bridge across the Danube at [[Svishtov]]. After a short battle in which the Russians suffered 812 killed and wounded,<ref>{{Citation | title = Bayonets before Bullets: The Imperial Russian Army, 1861–1914 | first = Bruce | last = Menning | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 2000 | page = 57}}.</ref> the Russian secured the opposing bank and drove off the Ottoman infantry brigade defending Svishtov. At this point the Russian force was divided into three parts: the Eastern Detachment under the command of [[Tsarevich]] Alexander Alexandrovich, the future Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia]], assigned to capture the fortress of Ruschuk and cover the army's eastern flank; the Western Detachment, to capture the fortress of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria]] and cover the army's western flank; and the Advance Detachment under Count [[Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko]], which was assigned to quickly move via [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and penetrate the [[Balkan Mountains]], the most significant barrier between the Danube and Constantinople.

[[File:Boj u Ivanovo-Chiflik.jpg|thumb|Fighting near Ivanovo-Chiflik]]

Responding to the Russian crossing of the Danube, the Ottoman high command in Constantinople ordered [[Osman Nuri Paşa]] to advance east from [[Vidin]] occupy the fortress of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]], just west of the Russian crossing. On his way to Nikopol, Osman Pasha learned that the Russians had already captured the fortress and so moved to the crossroads town of Plevna (now known as [[Pleven]]), which he occupied with a force of approximately 15,000 on 19 July (NS).{{Sfn | von Herbert | 1895 | p = 131}} The Russians, approximately 9,000 under the command of General Schilder-Schuldner, reached Plevna early in the morning. Thus began the [[Siege of Plevna]].

Osman Pasha organized a defense and repelled two Russian attacks with colossal casualties on the Russian side. At that point, the sides were almost equal in numbers and the Russian army was very discouraged.<ref>{{Citation | title = Reminiscences of the King of Roumania | publisher = Harper & Brothers | year = 1899 | pages = 274–75 | url = https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofk00kremiala#page/274/mode/2up}}.</ref> Most analysts agree that a counter-attack would have allowed the Ottomans to gain control of, and destroy, the Russians' bridge.{{who|date=August 2009}} However, Osman Pasha had orders to stay fortified in Plevna, and so he did not leave that fortress.

Russia had no more troops to throw against Plevna, so the Russians besieged it, and subsequently asked<ref>{{Citation | title = Reminiscences of the King of Roumania | publisher = Harper & Brothers | year = 1899 | page = 275 | url = https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofk00kremiala#page/274/mode/2up}}.</ref> the Romanians to provide extra troops. On August 9, Suleiman Pasha made an attempt to help Osman Pasha with 30,000 troops, but he was stopped by Bulgarians at the [[Battle of Shipka Pass]]. After three days of fighting, the volunteers were relieved by a Russian force led by General Radezky, and the Turkish forces withdrew. Soon afterwards, Romanian forces crossed the Danube and joined the siege. On August 16, at Gorni-Studen, the armies (West Army group) around Plevna were placed under the command of the Romanian Prince [[Carol I]], aided by the Russian general Pavel Dmitrievich Zotov and the Romanian general [[Alexandru Cernat]].

The Turks maintained several fortresses around Pleven which the Russian and Romanian forces gradually reduced.<ref>{{Citation | last = Furneaux | first = Rupert | title = The Siege of Pleven | year = 1958}}.</ref>{{Sfn|von Herbert|1895}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2013}} The Romanian 4th Division led by General [[Gheorghe Manu]] took the Grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults and managed to keep it until the very end of the siege. The [[siege of Plevna]] (July–December 1877) turned to victory only after Russian and Romanian forces cut off all supply routes to the fortified Ottomans. With supplies running low, Osman Pasha made an attempt to break the Russian siege in the direction of Opanets. On December 9, in the middle of the night the Ottomans threw bridges over the Vit River and crossed it, attacked on a {{convert |2|mi|km|adj =on}} front and broke through the first line of Russian trenches. Here they fought hand to hand and bayonet to bayonet, with little advantage to either side. Outnumbering the Ottomans almost 5 to 1, the Russians drove the Ottomans back across the Vit. Osman Pasha was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet, which killed his horse beneath him. Making a brief stand, the Ottomans eventually found themselves driven back into the city, losing 5,000 men to the Russians' 2,000. The next day, Osman surrendered the city, the garrison, and his sword to the Romanian colonel, [[Mihail Cerchez]]. He was treated honorably, but his troops perished in the snows by the thousand as they straggled off into captivity. The more seriously wounded were left behind in their camp hospitals, only to be murdered by the Bulgarians.<ref>{{Citation | author = Lord Kinross | title = The Ottoman Centuries | year = 1977 | page = 522 | publisher = Morrow Quill}}.</ref>{{dubious |date=January 2011}}

[[File:Zahvat grivickogo reduta.jpg|thumb|Taking of the Grivitsa redoubt by the Russians – a few hours later the redoubt was recaptured by the Ottomans and fell to the Romanians on 30 August 1877 in what became known as the "Third Battle of Grivitsa".]]

At this point Serbia, having finally secured monetary aid from Russia, declared war on the Ottoman Empire again. This time there were far fewer Russian officers in the Serbian army but this was more than offset by the experience gained from the 1876–77 war. Under nominal command of [[Milan I of Serbia|prince Milan Obrenović]] (effective command was in hands of general [[Kosta Protić]], the army chief of staff), the [[Serbian Army]] went on offensive in what is now eastern south Serbia. A planned offensive into the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] was called off due to strong diplomatic pressure from [[Austria-Hungary]], which wanted to prevent Serbia and Montenegro from coming into contact, and which had designs to spread Austria-Hungary's influence through the area. The Ottomans, outnumbered unlike two years before, mostly confined themselves to passive defence of fortified positions. By the end of hostilities the Serbs had captured Ak-Palanka (today [[Bela Palanka]]), [[Pirot]], [[Niš]] and [[Vranje]].

[[File:Battle at river Skit 1877.jpg|thumb|left|Battle at bridge Skit, November 1877]]

Russians under [[Field Marshal]] [[Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko]] succeeded in capturing the passes at the [[Stara Planina]] mountain, which were crucial for maneuvering. Next, both sides fought a series of [[Battle of Shipka Pass|battles for Shipka Pass]]. Gourko made several attacks on the [[Shipka Pass|Pass]] and eventually secured it. Ottoman troops spent much effort to recapture this important route, to use it to reinforce Osman Pasha in Pleven, but failed. Eventually Gourko led a final offensive that crushed the Ottomans around Shipka Pass. The Ottoman offensive against Shipka Pass is considered one of the major mistakes of the war, as other passes were virtually unguarded. At this time a huge number of Ottoman troops stayed fortified along the Black Sea coast and engaged in very few operations.

A Russian army crossed the Stara Planina by a high snowy pass in winter, guided and helped by local Bulgarians, not expected by the Ottoman army, and defeated the Turks at the [[Battle of Tashkessen]] and [[Battle of Sofia|took Sofia]]. The way was now open for a quick advance through [[Plovdiv]] and [[Edirne]] to [[Constantinople]].

Besides the [[Romanian Army]] (which mobilized 130,000 men, losing 10,000 of them to this war), a strong [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finnish]] contingent and more than 12,000 volunteer Bulgarian troops (''Opalchenie'') from the local [[Bulgaria]]n population as well as many ''[[hajduk]]'' detachments fought in the war on the side of the Russians. To express his gratitude to the Finnish battalion, the Tsar elevated the battalion on their return home to the name ''[[Old Guards (Russia)|Old Guard]] Battalion''.

After Bulgarian territories were liberated by the [[Imperial Russian Army]] during the war, they were governed initially by a [[Provisional Russian Administration in Bulgaria|provisional Russian administration]], which was established in April 1877. The [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] provided for the termination of this provisional Russian administration in May 1879, when the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] and [[Eastern Rumelia]] were established.<ref name="БДИ">{{cite book | year = 1987 | title = Българските държавни институции 1879–1986 | trans-title= Bulgarian State Institutions 1879–1986 | publisher = ДИ "Д-р Петър Берон" | location = София (Sofia, Bulgaria)| pages = 54–55}}</ref> The main objectives of the temporary Russian administration were to secure peace and order and to prepare for a revival of the Bulgarian state.

==Aftermath==
===Intervention by the Great Powers===
Under pressure from the British, Russia accepted the truce offered by the Ottoman Empire on January 31, 1878, but continued to move towards [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].

The British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the city, and Russian forces stopped at [[San Stefano]]. Eventually Russia entered into a settlement under the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire would recognize the independence of [[Principality of Romania|Romania]], Serbia, and Montenegro, and the autonomy of [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].

Alarmed by the extension of Russian power into the Balkans, the [[Great Powers]] later forced modifications of the treaty in the [[Congress of Berlin]]. The main change here was that Bulgaria would be split, according to earlier agreements among the Great Powers that precluded the creation of a large new Slavic state: the northern and eastern parts to become principalities as before (Bulgaria and [[Eastern Rumelia]]), though with different governors; and the Macedonian region, originally part of Bulgaria under San Stefano, would return to direct Ottoman administration.<ref>L.S.

[[File:Carol Popp de Szathmáry - Cerchez călare.jpg|thumb|250px|Circassian horseman, during the Russo-Turkish War]]
Muslim civilian casualties during the war are often estimated in the tens of thousands.<ref>{{Citation | title = Genocide in the Age of the Nation State: The rise of the West and the coming of genocide | first = Mark | last = Levene | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3PsLXeDflfMC&pg=PA225&dq=muslims++1878+bulgaria+%22tens+of+thousands%22&hl=en&ei=tn89TdzJCY72sgaRttHzBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=muslims%20%201878%20bulgaria%20%22tens%20of%20thousands%22&f=false | page = 225}}.</ref> The perpetrators of those massacres are also disputed, with American historian [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], claiming that they were carried out by Russian soldiers, Cossacks as well as Bulgarian volunteers and villagers, though there were few civilian casualties in battle.<ref name="McCarthy, J. 2001, p. 48">{{Citation | last = McCarthy | first = J | title = The Ottoman Peoples and the end of Empire | year = 2001 | page = 48 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}.</ref> while [[James J. Reid]] claims that [[Circassians]] were significantly responsible for the refugee flow, that there were civilian casualties from battle and even that the Ottoman army was responsible for casualties among the Muslim population.{{Sfn | Reid | 2000 | pp = 42–43}} According to [[John Joseph (academic)|John Joseph]] the Russian troops made frequent massacres of Muslim peasants to prevent them from disrupting their supply and troop movements. During the [[Harmanli Massacre|Battle of Harmanli]] accompanying this retaliation on Muslim non-combatants, it was reported that a huge group of Muslim townspeople were attacked by the Russian army, which as a result thousands died and their goods confiscated.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Congress of Berlin and after | first = William Norton | last = Medlicott | page = 157}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Muslim-Christian Relations and Inter-Christian Rivalries in the Middle East | first = John | last = Joseph | page = 84 | year = 1983}}.</ref> The correspondent of the ''Daily News'' describes as an eyewitness the burning of four or five Turkish villages by the Russian troops in response to the Turks firing at the Russians from the villages, instead of behind rocks or trees{{Sfn | Reid | 2000 | p = 324}}, which must have appeared to the Russian soldiers as guerrilla attempts by the local Muslim populace upon the Russian contingencies operating against the Ottoman forces embedded in the area.

The number of Muslim refugees is estimated by [[RJ Crampton]] to be 130,000.<ref>{{Citation | last = Crampton | first = RJ | title = A Concise History of Bulgaria | year = 1997 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | ISBN = 0-521-56719-X | page = 426}}.</ref> [[Richard C.

During the conflict a number of Muslim buildings and cultural centres were destroyed. A large library of old Turkish books was destroyed when a mosque in Turnovo was burned in 1877.{{Sfn | Crampton | 2006 | p = 111}} Most mosques in Sofia perished, seven of them destroyed in one night in December 1878 when a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers."{{Sfn | Crampton | 2006 | p = 114}}

The Christian population, especially in the initial stages of the war, that found itself in the path of the Ottoman armies also suffered greatly.

The most notable massacre of Bulgarian civilians took part after the July [[Battle of Stara Zagora|battle]] of [[Stara Zagora]] when Gurko's forces had to retreat back to the Shipka pass. In the aftermath of the battle [[Suleiman Pasha (Ottoman general)|Suleiman Pasha]]'s forces burned down and plundered the town of Stara Zagora which by that time was one of the largest towns in the Bulgarian lands. The number of massacred Christian civilians during the battle is estimated at 15,000. Suleiman Pasha's forces also established in the whole valley of the [[Maritsa]] river a system of terror taking form in the hanging at the street corners of every Bulgarian who had in any way assisted the Russians, but even villages that had not assisted the Russians were destroyed and their inhabitants massacred.{{Sfn | Argyll | 1879 | p = 49}} As a result, as many as 100,000 civilian Bulgarians fled north to the Russian occupied territories.<ref name="Report on the Russian Army">{{cite book | first =Francis Vinton | last = Greene | title = Report on the Russian Army and its Campaigns in Turkey in 1877–1878 | publisher = D Appleton & Co | year = 1879 | page = 204}}</ref> Later on in the campaign the Ottoman forces [[Scorched earth|planned to burn]] the town of [[Sofia]] after Gurko had managed to overcome their resistance in the passes of Western part of the [[Balkan Mountains]]. Only the refusal of the Italian Consul [[Vito Positano]], the French Vice Consul Léandre François René le Gay and the Austro–Hungarian Vice Consul to leave Sofia prevented that from happening. After the Ottoman retreat, Positano even organized armed detachments to protect the population from [[Outlaw|marauders]] (regular Ottoman Army [[deserter]]s, [[bashi-bazouk]]s and [[Circassians]]).<ref name="sega">{{cite news|url=http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=315&sectionid=4&id=00004|title=Позитано.

===Effects on Bulgaria's Jewish population===
Many Jewish communities in their entirety fled with the retreating Turks as their protectors. The ''Bulletins de l'[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'' reported that thousands of [[Bulgarian Jews]] found refuge at the Ottoman capital of [[Constantinople]].<ref>Tamir, V., ''Bulgaria and Her Jews: A dubious symbiosis'', 1979, p. 94–95, Yeshiva University Press</ref>

===Internationalization of the Armenian Question===
[[File:Emigration of Armenians into Georgia during the Russo-Turkish war of 1878-9 (A).jpg|thumb|Emigration of Armenians into Georgia during the Russo-Turkish war]]
The conclusion of the Russo-Turkish war also led to the internationalization of the [[Armenian Question]]. Many [[Armenians]] in the eastern provinces ([[Turkish Armenia]]) of the Ottoman Empire greeted the advancing Russians as liberators. Violence and instability directed at Armenians during the war by Kurd and Circassian bands had left many Armenians looking toward the invading Russians as the ultimate guarantors of their security. In January 1878, [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Nerses II Varzhapetian]] approached the Russian leadership with the view of receiving assurances that the Russians would introduce provisions in the prospective peace treaty for self-administration in the Armenian provinces. Though not as explicit, Article 16 of the Treaty of San Stefano read:
{{quotation |As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the Sublime Porte engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and Circassians.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hertslet | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Hertslet | title = The Map of Europe by Treaty | volume = 4 | place = London | publisher = Butterworths | year = 1891 | page = 2686}}.</ref>}}

Great Britain, however, took objection to Russia holding on to so much Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations by convening the Congress of Berlin in June 1878. An Armenian delegation led by prelate [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] traveled to Berlin to present the case of the Armenians but, much to its chagrin, was left out of the negotiations. Article 16 was modified and watered down, and all mention of the Russian forces remaining in the provinces was removed. In the final text of the Treaty of Berlin, it was transformed into Article 61, which read:
{{quotation |The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to this effect to the powers, who will superintend their application.<ref>{{Citation | last = Hurewitz | first = Jacob C | title = Diplomacy in the Near and Middle East: A Documentary Record 1535–1956 | volume = I | place = Princeton, NJ | publisher = Van Nostrand | year = 1956 | page = 190}}.</ref>}}

As it turned out, the reforms were not forthcoming. Khrimian returned to Constantinople and delivered a famous speech in which he likened the peace conference to a {{"'}}big cauldron of Liberty Stew' into which the big nations dipped their 'iron ladles' for real results, while the Armenian delegation had only a 'Paper Ladle'. 'Ah dear Armenian people,' Khrimian said, 'could I have dipped my Paper Ladle in the cauldron it would sog and remain there!

===International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement===
[[File:Croixrouge logos.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Red Cross]] and the [[Red Crescent]] emblems]]
This war caused a division in the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|emblems]] of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] which continues to this day. Both Russia and the Ottoman Empire had signed the [[First Geneva Convention]] (1864), which made the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Cross|Red Cross]], a color reversal of the [[Flag of Switzerland|flag]] of neutral [[Switzerland]], the sole emblem of protection for military medical personnel and facilities. However, during this war the cross instead reminded the Ottomans of the [[Crusades]]; so they elected to replace the cross with the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Crescent|Red Crescent]] instead. This ultimately became the symbol of the Movement's national societies in most [[Muslim]] countries, and was ratified as an emblem of protection by later [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1929 and again in 1949 (the current version).

[[Iran]], which neighbored both the Russian Empire and Ottoman Empire, considered them to be rivals, and probably considered the Red Crescent in particular to be an Ottoman symbol; except for the Red Crescent being centered and without a star, it is a color reversal of the [[Ottoman flag]] (and the modern [[Flag of Turkey|Turkish flag]]). This appears to have led to their national society in the Movement being initially known as the [[Red Lion and Sun Society]], using a [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#The Red Lion and Sun|red version]] of the [[Lion and Sun]], a traditional Iranian symbol. After the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Iran switched to the Red Crescent, but the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize the Red Lion and Sun as an emblem of protection.

==In popular culture==
The novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (Polish title: ''Lalka''), written in 1887–1889 by [[Bolesław Prus]], describes consequences of the Russo-Turkish war for merchants living in Russia and partitioned Poland. The main protagonist helped his Russian friend, a multi-millionaire, and made a fortune supplying the Russian Army in 1877–1878. The novel describes trading during political instability, and its ambiguous results for Russian and Polish societies.

The 1912 silent film ''[[Independența României]]'' depicted the war in [[Romania]].

[[File:Treaty of San Stefano.jpg|thumb|300px|The signing of the treaty of San Stefano]]
The 1878 '''Preliminary Treaty of San Stefano''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Сан-Стефанский мир; Peace of San-Stefano, Сан-Стефанский мирный договор; Peace treaty of San-Stefano, [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Ayastefanos Muahedesi'' or ''Ayastefanos Antlaşması'') was a treaty between [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] signed at [[Yeşilköy|San Stefano]], then a village west of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], on {{OldStyleDate|3 March |1878|19 February}} by Count [[Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev]] and [[Aleksandr Nelidov]] on behalf of the Russian Empire and Foreign Minister [[Mehmed Esad Saffet Paşa|Safvet Pasha]] and Ambassador to Germany [[Sadullah Pasha|Sadullah Bey]] on behalf of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hertslet |first= Edward |author-link=Edward Hertslet |year=1891 |editor-last=  |editor-first= |contribution= Preliminary Treaty of Peace between Russia and Turkey.

According to the official Russian position, by signing the treaty, Russia had never intended anything more than a temporary rough draft, so as to enable a final settlement with the other Great Powers.<ref>{{Citation |last= Holland|first= Thomas Erskine |author-link= Thomas Erskine Holland |year=1898 |editor-last=  |editor-first= |contribution= The Execution of the Treaty of Berlin |title= Studies in International Law |volume=  |edition= |publisher=  Clarendon Press |publication-date= |publication-place= Oxford |pages= 227 |url= https://archive.org/stream/cu31924007461654#page/n237/mode/2up |accessdate=2013-02-02 }}</ref><ref>Although it was inconsistent with the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris of 1856]] and with the London Convention of 1871, and for that reason was justly protested by Great Britain, the Preliminary Treaty of Peace of San Stefano was, according to [[International law|general international law]], valid.

The treaty provided for the creation of an autonomous [[Principality of Bulgaria]] following almost 500 years of Ottoman domination. The day the treaty was signed,  {{OldStyleDate|3 March |1878|19 February}}, is celebrated as Liberation Day in Bulgaria. However, the enlarged Bulgaria envisioned by the treaty alarmed neighboring states as well as France and Great Britain.  As a result, it was never implemented, being superseded by the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] following the [[Congress of Berlin|Congress]] of the same name that took place three months later.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bulgaria/History}}</ref>

==Effects==

===On Bulgaria===
[[File:Bulgaria-SanStefano -(1878)-byTodorBozhinov.png|right|thumb|300px|Borders of Bulgaria according to the Preliminary Treaty of San Stefano and the Treaty of Berlin.]] The treaty established  the autonomous self-governing [[Principality of Bulgaria]], with a Christian government and the right to keep an army. Though still ''[[de jure]]'' tributary to Turkey, the Principality ''[[de facto]]'' functioned as independent nation. Its territory included the plain between the [[Danube]] and the Balkan mountain range ([[Stara Planina]]), the region of [[Sofia]], [[Pirot]] and [[Vranje]] in the [[Morava rivers, Serbia|Morava]] valley, Northern [[Thrace]], parts of [[Eastern Thrace]] and nearly all of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] (Article 6).

Bulgaria would thus have had direct access to the [[Mediterranean]]. This carried the potential of [[Russia]]n ships eventually using Bulgarian Mediterranean ports as naval bases - which the other Great Powers greatly disliked.   

A prince elected by the people, approved by Turkey, and recognized by the [[Great Powers]] was to take the helm of the country (Article 7). A council of Bulgarian noblemen was to draft a constitution (also Article 7). (They produced the [[Tarnovo Constitution]].) Ottoman troops were to withdraw from Bulgaria, while Russian troops would remain for two more years (Article 8).

===Montenegro, Serbia, and Romania===
Under the treaty, [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] more than doubled its territory, acquiring formerly Ottoman-controlled areas including the cities of [[Nikšić]], [[Podgorica]], and [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Article 1), and the Ottoman Empire recognized its independence (Article 2).

[[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] gained the cities of [[Niš]] and [[Leskovac]] in [[Moravian Serbia]] and became independent (Article 3).

Turkey recognized the independence of [[Romanian Principalities|Romania]] (Article 5). Romania gained [[Northern Dobruja]] from Russia (to which it was transferred from the Ottoman Empire) and ceded [[Southern Bessarabia]] in a forced exchange.

===On Russia and the Ottoman Empire===
[[Image:HouseOfSanStefanoTreaty.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Treaty was signed in this house of the Simeonoglou family in [[Yeşilköy]].]]
In exchange for the [[war reparations]], the Porte ceded [[Armenia]]n and [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] territories in the [[Caucasus]] to Russia, including [[Ardahan]], [[Artvin]], [[Batumi|Batum]], [[Kars]], [[Oltu|Olti]], [[Doğubeyazıt|Beyazit]], and [[Eleşkirt|Alashkert]]. Additionally, it ceded [[Northern Dobruja]], which Russia handed to Romania in exchange for [[Southern Bessarabia]] (Article 19).

===On other regions===
The [[Vilayet of Bosnia]] ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) was supposed to become an autonomous province (Article 14) like Serbia was; [[Crete]], [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] were to receive a limited form of local self-government (Article 15), while the Ottomans vouched for their earlier-given promises to handle reforms in [[Armenia]] in order to protect the Armenians from abuse (Article 16).

The Straits — the [[Bosporus]] and the [[Dardanelles]] — were declared open to all neutral ships in war and peacetime (Article 24).

==Reaction==
[[File:Karti od Sanstefan i Berlinski kongres 1878.jpg|thumb|400px|Maps of the region after the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin of 1878]]
The Great Powers, especially British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]], were unhappy with this extension of Russian power, and Serbia feared the establishment of [[Greater Bulgaria]] would harm its interests in former and remaining Ottoman territories. These reasons prompted the Great Powers to obtain a revision of the treaty at the [[Congress of Berlin]], and substitute the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]].

Romania, which had contributed significantly to the Russian victory in the war, was extremely disappointed by the treaty, and the Romanian public perceived some of its stipulations as Russia breaking the Russo-Romanian pre-war treaties that guaranteed the integrity of Romanian territory.

[[Austria-Hungary]] was disappointed with the treaty as it failed to expand its influence in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The [[Albania]]ns, dwelling in provinces controlled by the Ottoman Empire, objected to what they considered a significant loss of their territory to Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro and realized they would have to organize nationally to attract the assistance of foreign powers seeking to neutralize Russia's influence in the region. The implications of the treaty led to the formation of the [[League of Prizren]].<ref>Gawrych, George. ''The Crescent and the Eagle''. London: I.B. Tauris, 2006, pp. 44-49.</ref>

It is important to note that in the "Salisbury Circular" of 1 April 1878, the British Foreign Secretary, [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Salisbury]], made clear his and his government's objections to the Treaty of San Stefano and the favorable position in which it left Russia.

According to British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]], writing in 1954, "If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for <nowiki>[</nowiki>Disraeli<nowiki>]</nowiki> in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878 'We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.'"<ref>[[A. J. P. Taylor|Taylor, A. J. P.]] (1954) ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1914-1918''. Oxford University Press, p. 253.</ref>

The '''Congress of Berlin''' (13 June – 13 July 1878) was a meeting of the representatives of six [[great powers]] of the time (Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Germany),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=EhqpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=congress+of+Berlin++1878++six++great+powers&hl=cs&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiInOfXtqvTAhXGEiwKHTNCAGEQ6AEIITAA#v=onepage&q=congress%20of%20Berlin%20%201878%20%20six%20%20great%20powers&f=false|title=Iran-Turkey Relations, 1979-2011: Conceptualising the Dynamics of Politics, Religion and Security in Middle-Power States– Google Knihy |publisher=Books.google.cz |date= March 1, 2013|accessdate=2017-04-17|isbn=978-0-415-68087-5}}</ref> the Ottoman Empire and four Balkan states (Greece, Serbia, Romania and Montenegro). It aimed at determining the territories of the states in the [[Balkan peninsula]] following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] and came to an end with the signing of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which replaced the preliminary [[Treaty of San Stefano]], signed three months earlier between [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[[File:Balkans 1878.png|thumb|Borders in the Balkan peninsula after the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]]]]

German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], who led the Congress, undertook to stabilise the Balkans, recognise the reduced power of the Ottoman Empire and balance the distinct interests of Britain, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. At the same time, he tried to diminish Russian gains in the region and to prevent the rise of a [[Greater Bulgaria]]. As a result, Ottoman lands in Europe declined sharply, Bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, [[Eastern Rumelia]] was restored to the Turks under a special administration and the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] was returned outright to the Turks, who promised reform.

[[Romania]] achieved full independence; forced to turn over part of [[Bessarabia]] to Russia, it gained [[Northern Dobruja]]. [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] finally gained complete independence but with smaller territories, with Austria-Hungary occupying the [[Sandzak|Sandžak (Raška) region]].<ref>[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos128.htm Vincent Ferraro. The Austrian Occupation of Novibazar, 1878–1909 (based on: Anderson, Frank Maloy and Amos Shartle Hershey, Handbook for the Diplomatic History of Europe, Asia, and Africa 1870–1914. National Board for Historical Service. Government Printing Office, Washington, 1918.]</ref> Austria-Hungary also took over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and Britain took over [[Cyprus]].

The results were first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilisation. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances on the results festered until they exploded in the [[First Balkan War|First]] and the [[Second Balkan War|Second]] Balkan wars in 1912–1913 and eventually [[World War I]] in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece made gains, but all received far less than they thought that they deserved.

The Ottoman Empire, then called the "sick man of Europe", was humiliated and significantly weakened, which made it more liable to domestic unrest and more vulnerable to attack.

Although Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated there and resented its treatment. Austria gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs, and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bismarck became the target of hatred by Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and he would find that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria-Hungary in the Balkans.<ref>Jerome L. Blum, et al. ''The European World: A History'' (1970) p. 841</ref>

In the long run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The congress was aimed at revising the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] and at keeping [[Constantinople]] within Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia's victory over the decaying Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War. The congress returned territories to the Ottoman Empire that the previous treaty had given to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], most notably [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria, leading in 1912 to the First Balkan War.

==Background==
[[Image:Edward Stanford 1877.jpg|left|thumb|Pro-Greek ethnic map of the [[Balkans]] by Ioannis Gennadius,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEyinJwjWIgC&pg=PA169 |first=I.

In the decades leading up to the congress, Russia and the Balkans had been gripped by [[Pan-Slavism]], a movement to unite all the Balkan Slavs under one rule. That desire, which evolved similarly to the [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanism]] and [[Italian Unification|Pan-Italianism]], which had resulted in two unifications, took different forms in the various Slavic nations. In Imperial Russia, Pan-Slavism meant the creation of a unified Slavic state, under Russian direction, and essentially a byword for Russian conquest of the Balkan peninsula.<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, p. 228.</ref> The realisation of the goal would have Russian control of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]], thus giving Russia economic control of the [[Black Sea]] and substantially increasing its geopolitical power.   In the Balkans, Pan-Slavism meant unifying the Balkan Slavs under the rule of a particular Balkan state, but the state that was meant to serve as the locus for unification was not always clear, as initiative wafted between Serbia and Bulgaria.  The creation of a Bulgarian exarch by the Ottomans in 1870 had been intended to separate the Bulgarians religiously from the Greek patriarch and politically from Serbia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan J.

Though the views of how Balkan politics should proceed differed, both began with the deposition of the sultan as ruler of the Balkans and the ousting of the Ottomans from Europe.  How and even whether that was to proceed would be the major question to be answered at the Congress of Berlin.

==Great powers in the Balkans==
The Balkans were a major stage for competition between the European [[great powers]] in the second half of the 19th century. Britain and Russia both had interests in the fate of the Balkans. Russia was interested in the region, both ideologically, as a pan-Slavist unifier, and practically, to secure greater control of the Mediterranean; Britain was interested in preventing Russia from accomplishing its goals. Furthermore, the Unifications of Italy and Germany had stymied the ability of a third European power, Austria-Hungary, to further expand its domain to the southwest. Germany, as the most powerful continental nation after the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] had little direct interest in the settlement and so was the only power that could mediate the Balkan question.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135–137}}

Russia and Austria-Hungary, the two powers that were most invested in the fate of the Balkans, were allied with Germany in the conservative [[League of Three Emperors]], founded to preserve the monarchies of [[Continental Europe]]. The Congress of Berlin was thus mainly a dispute among supposed Bismarck and his German Empire, the arbiter of the discussion, would thus have to choose before the end of the congress one of their allies to support. That decision was to have direct consequences on the future of European geopolitics.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Norton Medlicott|title=Congress of Berlin and After|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU7YAQAAQBAJ|year=1963|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-24317-2|pages=14–}}</ref>{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135–137}}

Ottoman brutality in the [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78)|Serbian–Ottoman War]] and the violent suppression of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)|Herzegovina Uprising]] formented political pressure within Russia, which saw itself as the protector of the Serbs, to act against the Ottoman Empire. David MacKenzie wrote that 'sympathy for the Serbian Christians existed in Court circles, among nationalist diplomats, and in the lower classes, and was actively expressed through the Slav committees'.<ref name="MacKenzie1967">{{cite book|author=David MacKenzie|title=The Serbs and Russian Pan-Slavism, 1875-1878|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bQMAAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=7}}</ref>

Eventually, Russia sought and obtained Austria-Hungary's pledge of benevolent neutrality in the coming war, in return for ceding Bosnia Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary in the [[Budapest Convention of 1877]].

==Treaty of San Stefano==

After the Bulgarian [[April Uprising]] in 1876 and the Russian victory in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], Russia had liberated almost all of the Ottoman European possessions.  The Ottomans recognized Montenegro, Romania and Serbia as independent, and the territories of all three were expanded. Russia created a large Principality of Bulgaria as an autonomous vassal of the sultan.  This expanded Russia's sphere of influence to encompass the entire Balkans, which alarmed other powers in Europe. Britain, which had threatened war with Russia if it occupied [[Constantinople]],<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 239–40.</ref> and France both did not want another power meddling in either the Mediterranean or the Middle East, where both powers were prepared to make large [[Scramble for Africa|colonial gains]].  Austria-Hungary desired Habsburg control over the Balkans, and Germany wanted to prevent its ally from going to war. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck thus called the Congress of Berlin to discuss the partition of the Ottoman Balkans among the European powers and to preserve the League of Three Emperors in the face of the spread of European [[Liberalism#Spread of liberalism|liberalism]].{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=135–138}}

The Congress was attended by Britain, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Delegates from [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] attended the sessions that concerned their states, but they were not members of the Congress. The Congress was solicited by Russia's rivals, particularly Austria-Hungary and Britain, and it was hosted in 1878 by [[Otto von Bismarck]]. It proposed and ratified the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]]. The meetings were held at Bismarck's [[Reich Chancellery]], the former [[Radziwill]] Palace, from 13 June 1878 to 13 July 1878.  The congress revised or eliminated 18 of the 29 articles in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. Furthermore, by using as a foundation the Treaties of [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Paris (1856)]] and [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Washington]] (1871), the treaty rearranged the East.

==Other powers' fear of Russian influence==
[[File:Ernst-Ravenstein-Balkans-Ethnic-Map-1880.jpg|thumb|Ethnic composition map of the [[Balkans]] by the German-English cartographer [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein]] of 1870]]

The principal mission of the participants at the congress was to deal a fatal blow to the burgeoning movement of [[pan-Slavism]]. The movement caused serious concern in Berlin and even more so in Vienna, which was afraid that the repressed Slavic nationalities would revolt against the [[Habsburgs]]. The [[British government|British]] and the [[France|French]] governments were nervous about both the diminishing influence of the Ottoman Empire and the cultural expansion of Russian to the south, where both Britain and France were poised to colonise [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. By the Treaty of San Stefano, the Russians, led by Chancellor [[Alexander Gorchakov]], had managed to create in a [[Bulgaria]] an autonomous principality, under the nominal rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. That sparked the [[Great Game]], the massive British fear of the growing Russian influence in the [[Middle East]]. The new principality, including a very large portion of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and with access to the [[Aegean Sea]], could easily threaten the [[Dardanelle Straits]], which separate the [[Black Sea]] from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The arrangement was not acceptable to the British, which considered the entire Mediterranean to be a British [[sphere of influence]] and saw any Russian attempt to gain access there as a grave threat to British power. On 4 June, before the Congress opened on 13 June, Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli|Lord Beaconsfield]] had already concluded the [[Cyprus Convention]], a secret alliance with the Ottomans against Russia in which Britain was allowed to occupy the strategically-placed island of [[Cyprus]]. The agreement predetermined Beaconsfield's position during the Congress and led him to issue threats to unleash a war against Russia if it did not comply with Ottoman demands. Negotiations between Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] and British Foreign Secretary [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] had already 'ended on 6 June by Britain agreeing to all the Austrian proposals relative to Bosnia-Herzegovina about to come before the congress while Austria would support British demands'.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=20}}

==Bismarck as host==
The Congress of Berlin is frequently viewed as the culmination of the battle between Chancellors [[Alexander Gorchakov]] of Russia and [[Otto von Bismarck]] of Germany. They were able to persuade other European leaders that a free and independent [[Bulgaria]] would greatly improve the security risks posed by a disintegrating Ottoman Empire. According to historian [[Erich Eyck]], Bismarck supported Russia's position that "Turkish rule over a Christian community (Bulgaria) was an anachronism which undoubtedly gave rise to insurrection and bloodshed and should therefore be ended".<ref name="Eyck">Erich Eyck, ''Bismarck and the German Empire'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 1964), pp. 245–46.</ref> He used the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] of 1875 as proof of growing animosity in the region.

[[File:Bulgaria San Stefano Berlin 1878 TB.png|left|thumb|Borders of Bulgaria according to the preliminary [[Treaty of San Stefano]] (red stripes) and the superseding [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (solid red)]]

Bismarck's ultimate goal during the Congress of Berlin was not to upset Germany's status on the international platform. He did not wish to disrupt the [[League of the Three Emperors]] by choosing between Russia and Austria as an ally.<ref name="Eyck"/> To maintain peace in Europe, Bismarck sought to convince other European diplomats on dividing up the [[Balkans]] to foster greater stability. During the division, Russia began to feel cheated even though it eventually gained independence for Bulgaria. Problems in the alliances in Europe before the [[First World War]] were thus noticeable.

One reason that Bismarck was able to mediate the various tensions at the Congress of Berlin was his diplomatic persona. He sought peace and stability when international affairs did not pertain to Germany directly. Since he viewed the current situation in Europe as favourable for Germany, any conflicts between the major European powers that were threatening the status quo was against German interests. Also, at the Congress of Berlin, "Germany could not look for any advantage from the crisis" that had occurred in the Balkans in 1875.<ref name="Eyck"/> As a result, Bismarck claimed impartiality on behalf of Germany at the Congress. That claim enabled him to preside over the negotiations with a keen eye for foul play.

Though most of Europe went into the Congress expecting a diplomatic show, much like the [[Congress of Vienna]], they were to be sadly disappointed. Bismarck, unhappy to be conducting the Congress in the heat of the summer, had a short temper and a low tolerance for malarky. Thus, any grandstanding was cut short by the testy German chancellor. The ambassadors from the small Balkan territories whose fate was being decided were barely even allowed to attend the diplomatic meetings, which were between mainly the representatives of the great powers.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=138–140}}

According to [[Henry Kissinger]],<ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> the congress saw a shift in Bismarck's [[Realpolitik]]. Until then, as Germany had become too powerful for isolation, his policy was to maintain the League of the Three Emperors. Now that he could no longer rely on Russia's alliance, he began to form relations with as many potential enemies as possible.

Bowing to Russia's pressure, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were declared independent principalities.  Russia kept [[Bessarabia|South Bessarabia]], which it had annexed in the Russo-Turkish War, but the Bulgarian state that it had created was first bisected and then split further into the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, both of which were given nominal autonomy, under the control of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Oakes, Augustus, and R. B. Mowat. ''The Great European Treaties of the Nineteenth Century''. Clarendon Press, 1918, pp. 332–60.</ref> Bulgaria was promised autonomy, and guarantees were made against Turkish interference, but they were largely ignored. Romania received [[Dobruja]]. Montenegro obtained [[Nikšić]], along with the primary Albanian regions of [[Podgorica]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Plav-Gusinje]]. The Turkish government, or [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], agreed to obey the specifications contained in the Organic Law of 1868 and to guarantee the civil rights of non-Muslim subjects. The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina was given over to the administration of Austria-Hungary, which also obtained the right to garrison the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], a small border region between Montenegro and Serbia. Bosnia and Herzegovina were put on the fast track to eventual annexation. Russia agreed that [[Macedonia region|Macedonia]], the most important strategic section of the Balkans, was too multinational to be part of Bulgaria and permitted it to remain under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Eastern Rumelia]], which had its own large Turkish and Greek minorities, became an autonomous province under a Christian ruler, with its capital at [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]]. The remaining portions of the original "Greater Bulgaria" became the new state of Bulgaria.

In Russia, the Congress of Berlin was considered a dismal failure. After finally defeating the Turks despite many past inconclusive Russo-Turkish wars, many Russians had expected "something colossal", a redrawing of the Balkan borders in support of Russian territorial ambitions. Instead, the victory resulted in an Austro-Hungarian gain on the Balkan front that was brought about by the rest of the European powers' preference for a powerful Austria-Hungarian Empire, which threatened basically no one, to a powerful Russia, which had been locked in competition with Britain in the so-called [[Great Game]] for most of the century. Gorchakov said, "I consider the Berlin Treaty the darkest page in my life". The Russian people were by and large furious over the European repudiation of their political gains, and though there was some thought that it represented only a minor stumble on the road to Russian hegemony in the Balkans, it actually gave Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia over to Austria-Hungary's sphere of influence and essentially removed all Russian influence from the area.<ref>Ragsdale, Hugh, and V. N. Ponomarev. ''Imperial Russian Foreign Policy''. Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1993, pp. 244–46.</ref>

The Serbs were upset with "Russia... consenting to the cession of Bosnia to Austria."{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=32}}

<blockquote>
[[Jovan Ristić|Ristić]] who was Serbia’s first plenipotentiary at Berlin tells how he asked Jomini, one of the Russian delegates, what consolation remained to the Serbs. Jomini replied that it would have to be the thought that 'the situation was only temporary because within fifteen years at the latest we shall be forced to fight Austria.' 'Vain consolation!' comments Ristić.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=32}}
</blockquote>
[[File:Greek-Delegation-Berlin-Congress.jpg|thumb|Greek Delegation in the Berlin Congress]]
Italy was dissatisfied with the results of the Congress, and the tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire were left unresolved. Bosnia-Herzegovina would also prove to be problematic for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in later decades. The [[League of the Three Emperors]], established in 1873, was destroyed, as Russia saw lack of German support on the issue of Bulgaria's full independence as a breach of loyalty and of the alliance. The border between Greece and Turkey was not resolved. In 1881, after protracted negotiations, a compromise border [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|was accepted]], occurring after a naval demonstration of the great powers, resulting in the cession of [[Thessaly]] and the [[Arta Prefecture]] to Greece.

Thus, the Berlin Congress sowed the seeds of further conflicts, including the Balkan Wars and (ultimately) the [[First World War]]. In the 'Salisbury Circular' of 1 April 1878, the British Foreign Secretary, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]], made clear the objections of him and the government to the Treaty of San Stefano because of the favorable position in which it left Russia.<ref>Walker, Christopher J. (1980), ''Armenia: The Survival of A Nation'', London: Croom Helm, p. 112</ref>

In 1954, British historian [[AJP Taylor]] wrote: "If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for [[Disraeli|Beaconsfield]] in his wilder moments, had expected less and were therefore less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878: ''We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.''"<ref>AJP Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1914–1918,'' [[Oxford University Press]] (1954) p. 253</ref>

Though the Congress of Berlin constituted a harsh blow to [[Pan-Slavism]], it by no means solved the question of the area. The Slavs in the Balkans were still mostlty under non-Slavic rule, split between the rule of Austria-Hungary and the ailing Ottoman Empire. The Slavic states of the Balkans had learned that banding together as Slavs benefited them less than playing to the desires of a neighboring great power. That damaged the unity of the Balkan Slavs and encouraged competition between the fledgling Slav states.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|pp=133–134}}

The underlying tensions of the region would continue to simmer for 30 years until they again exploded in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913. In 1914, the [[assassination of Franz Ferdinand]] the Austro-Hungarian heir, led to the [[First World War]]. In hindsight, the stated goal of maintaining peace and balance of powers in the Balkans obviously failed, as the region would remain a source of conflict between the great powers well into the 20th century.{{sfn|Glenny|2000|p=151}}

==Internal opposition to Andrássy's objectives==

Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] and [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|the occupation and administration of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which remained under Ottoman administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] that "would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence".{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=19}} "High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired... [an] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective".{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=33}}

<blockquote>
On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, behind which stood the [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Albert]], were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution by his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion was lost by 179 to 95. By the Opposition rank and file the gravest accusations were raised against Andrassy.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=33}}
</blockquote>

On 10 October 1878, French diplomat [[Melchior de Vogüé]] described the situation as follows:

<blockquote>
Particularly in Hungary the dissatisfaction caused by this 'adventure' has reached the gravest proportions, prompted by that strong conservative instinct which animates the Magyar race and is the secret of its destinies. This vigorous and exclusive instinct explains the historical phenomenon of an isolated group, small in numbers yet dominating a country inhabited by a majority of peoples of different races and conflicting aspirations, and playing a role in European affairs out of all proportions to its numerical importance or intellectual culture. This instinct is today awakened and gives warning that it feels the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be a menace which, by introducing fresh Slav elements into the Hungarian political organism and providing a wider field and further recruitment of the Croat opposition, would upset the unstable equilibrium in which the Magyar domination is poised.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|pp=33–34}}

The '''Great Eastern Crisis''' of 1875–78 began in the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Rumelia|territories on the Balkan peninsula]] in 1875, with the outbreak of several uprisings and wars that resulted in the meddling of international powers, and was ended with the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in July 1878.

It is also called {{lang-sh|Velika istočna kriza}}; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Şark Buhranı'' ("Eastern Crisis", for the crisis in general), ''Ramazan Kararnamesi'' ("Decree of Ramadan", for the [[sovereign default]] declared on 30 October 1875) and ''93 Harbi'' ("War of 93", for the wars on the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] between 1877–78, referring in particular to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], the year 1293 on the Islamic [[Rumi calendar]] corresponding to the year 1877 on the [[Gregorian calendar]])

==Background==

The state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while at the same time managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia]] suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Austria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and [[irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents.

In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 [[battleship]]s and 173 warships of other types, which formed the third largest naval fleet in the world after those of the British and French navies. All of these expenditures, however, put a huge strain on the Ottoman treasury. In the meantime, a severe drought in [[Anatolia]] in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare a [[sovereign default]] on its foreign loan repayments on 30 October 1875 and increase taxes in all of its provinces, including the Balkans.<ref name=mevzuat/><ref name=Ferguson/>

===Uprisings and wars in the Balkans===
The decision to increase taxes for paying the Ottoman Empire's [[Ottoman public debt|debts to foreign creditors]] sparked an [[#Chronology of the Great Eastern Crisis and its aftermath|outrage in the Balkan provinces]], which culminated in the Great Eastern Crisis and ultimately the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] that provided independence or autonomy for the Christian nations in the empire's Balkan territories, with the subsequent [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878. The war, however, was disastrous for the already struggling Ottoman economy and the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] was established in 1881, which gave the control of the Ottoman state revenues to foreign creditors.<ref name=Ferguson/><ref name="Sovereignty">{{cite web|last1=Krasner|first1=Stephen D.|title=Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=tHJ5m56sBX4C |page=135 }} |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}</ref> This made the European creditors bondholders, and assigned special rights to the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|OPDA]] for collecting various types of tax and customs revenues.<ref name=Ferguson/> During and after the Serbian–Ottoman War of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the [[Armed forces of the Principality of Serbia|Serb army]] from the [[Sanjak of Niš|Sanjak of Niș]] and fled to the [[Kosovo Vilayet]].<ref>Pllana, Emin (1985).

==Aftermath==
After the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878, [[Austria-Hungary]] stationed military garrisons in the [[Bosnia Vilayet|Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia]] and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which formally ([[de jure]]) continued to be Ottoman territories. Taking advantage of the chaos that occurred during the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|Bulgaria declared its formal independence]] on 5 October 1908. The following day, [[Bosnian crisis|Austria-Hungary unilaterally annexed Bosnia]] on 6 October 1908, but pulled its military forces out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise with the Ottoman government and avoid a war (the Ottoman Empire lost the Sanjak of Novi Pazar with the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913.)

In 1881, [[France]] [[Beylik of Tunis|occupied the Ottoman Beylik of Tunisia]], with the excuse that Tunisian troops had crossed the border into [[French Algeria|their colony of Algeria]], which also [[Ottoman Algeria|formerly belonged to the Ottoman Empire]] until 1830. A year later, in 1882, the [[British Empire]] [[Khedivate of Egypt|occupied the Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt]], with the pretext of giving military assistance to the Ottomans for putting down the [[Urabi Revolt]] (Britain later declared Egypt [[Sultanate of Egypt|a British protectorate]] on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman government's decision to join [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]].<ref>[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Articles 17, 18 and 19 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]</ref>) It is worth noting that the Ottoman government had frequently declared the tax revenues from Egypt as a [[surety]] for borrowing loans from British and French banks.<ref name=derinstrateji/><ref name=mevzuat/> The Ottoman government had earlier [[Cyprus Convention|leased Cyprus to Britain]] in 1878, in exchange for British support at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in the same year (Cyprus was later annexed by Britain on 5 November 1914, for the same aforementioned reason regarding the Ottoman participation in World War I.<ref>[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Articles 20 and 21 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]</ref>) By obtaining Cyprus and Egypt, Britain gained an important foothold in the East Mediterranean and control over the [[Suez Canal]]; while France increased its lands in the West Mediterranean coast of [[North Africa]] by adding Tunisia to its empire [[French protectorate of Tunisia|as a French protectorate]].
